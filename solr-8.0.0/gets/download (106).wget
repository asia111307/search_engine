In a global and interconnected culture, we can no longer afford to identify only with people who seem to be a part of our &ldquo;tribe.&rdquo; As Dr. Helen Riess has learned, our capacity for empathy is not just an innate trait—it is also a skill that we can learn and expand. With <em><a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/1683640284/consortiuforrese">The Empathy Effect</a>,</em> Dr. Riess presents a definitive resource on empathy: the science behind how it works, new research on how empathy develops from birth to adulthood, and tools for building your capacity to create authentic emotional connection with others in any situation.</p>
                      <p>&ldquo;We are all connected on a neurobiological level far more than we have previously realized.

                      <p><strong>Nowack, K. (2017). Sleep, Emotional  Intelligence, and Interpersonal Effectiveness: Natural Bedfellows. <em>Consulting  Psychology Journal: Research and Practice</em>, 69, 66-79.</strong></p>
                      <p>According to the National Sleep  Foundation&rsquo;s Sleep in America Poll, U.S. adults sleep between 6.7 to 7.3 hr  every night, which has decreased by approximately 2 hours per night since the  19th century (National Sleep Foundation, 2016). Inconsistent or insufficient  sleep can be costly for business, impacting leadership decision  making/judgment, interpersonal relations, absenteeism, presenteeism, safety,  productivity, and health (Gaultney &amp; Collins-McNeil, 2009; Mills et al.,  2007; Rosekind et al., 2010). Daytime sleepiness can be dangerous, and  inadequate sleep is a known health hazard resulting in fatigue that can impair  both performance and social functioning. In light of existing research on the  effects of insufficient sleep on work performance, this study investigated the  relationship between self-reported sleep quality and quantity (Stress Profile)  of leaders with a concurrent evaluation of relationship skills by their manager  and others (direct reports and peers) on a measure of emotional and social  competence. Regression analyses indicated that leaders who reported poor  quality and quantity of sleep were rated significantly lower on interpersonal effectiveness  after controlling for gender and perceived work/life stress by their direct  reports and peers but not by their manager.</p>
<p><strong>Miao, C., Humphrey, R. H., &amp; Qian, S. (2017). A  meta-analysis of emotional intelligence effects on job satisfaction mediated by  job resources, and a test of moderators. <em>Personality and Individual Differences.</em> <em>116, 281–288.</em></strong><em></em></p>
                      <p>This paper examines whether job resources act as a mediator in the emotional intelligence (EI)—job satisfaction relationship, and examines possible moderators, including gender, age, tenure, and job level. We conducted a meta-analysis to explore these relationships. The meta-analysis demonstrated that: First, EI is positively related to job resources (k =15,N = 4151; overall EI: ^ρ= 0.27; ability EI: ^ρ= 0.24; self-report EI: ^ρ= 0.27; mixed EI: ^ρ= 0.28). Second, job resources mediate the relationship between EI and job satisfaction. Third, the relationship be-tween EI and job satisfaction does not differ across gender, age, and tenure, meaning that regardless of whether an employee is male or female, young or old, or having short or long tenure, they equally beneﬁt from EI. The moderator effect of job level is only signiﬁcant for self-report EI—job satisfaction and this relationship is stronger in non-managerial jobs than in managerial jobs. Yet, the moderator effect of job level is not signiﬁcant for ability EI—job satisfaction and mixed EI—job satisfaction meta-analytic distributions. These results indicate that EI aids employees by helping them obtain job resources, and that both job resources and EI have practical implications in terms of employee job satisfaction.</p>

                        organizational citizenship behavior and counterproductive work behavior.  <em>Personality and Individual Differences</em>, 116, 144-156.</strong></p>
                      <p>This research project examines whether emotional intelligence (EI) is related to organizational citizenship behavior
                        (OCB) and counterproductive work behavior (CWB). A key question concerns the degree to which EI is related
                        to OCB and CWB after controlling for other established predictors. The study uses meta-analytical
                        summaries of existing research (for EI-OCB, k=68, N = 16,386; for EI-CWB, k= 17, N = 3914). It uses meta-analytical
                        controls to obtain the best estimates of effect sizes, incremental validity, and relative importance.
                        This meta-analysis found that EI is positively associated with OCB and negatively related to CWB. When controlling
                        for ability measures of EI, the Big Five personality measures, general self-efficacy, cognitive intelligence, and
                        self-rated performance, both self-report measures of EI and mixed competency measures of EI show incremental
                        validity and relative importance in predicting OCB and CWB. An analysis of self-report EI found that the effects of
                        EI on OCB and CWB are stronger in health care and service industries than in industries where emotional labor
                        demands are lower. The results imply that organizations can increase OCB and reduce CWB by recruiting employees
                        high in EI and by training employees in emotional competencies.</p>

                        meta-analysis of main, mediator, and moderator effects. <em>Personality and Individual Differences</em>, 102, 13–24</strong>. </p>
                      <p>Based on a meta-analysis, leaders' emotional intelligence (EI) positively relates to subordinates' job satisfaction. . All three EI streams (ability, self-report, mixed) exhibit signiﬁcant incremental validity and relative importance (RW) in the presence of personality and cognitive ability in predicting subordinates' job satisfaction. Leaders' EI demonstrates signiﬁcant incremental validity and RW in the presence of subordinates' EI in predicting subordinates' job satisfaction. Subordinates' EI positively relates to leaders' EI and mediates the relationship between leaders' EI and subordinates' job satisfaction. Modera-tor analyses indicate that (1) ability EI has a lower association with subordinates' job satisfaction than self-report EI and mixed EI; and (2) leaders' EI more positively relates to subordinates' job satisfaction in low in-group col-lectivistic or low humane oriented cultures.</p>

It pays to have an eye for emotions: Emotion recognition ability indirectly predicts annual income.</strong> <strong><em>Journal of Organizational Behavior, 36,</em> 147-163</strong></p>
                      <p>This study examines how the emotion recognition ability relates to annual income. Participants were 142 employees working in various jobs and organizations in Germany. Emotion recognition was assessed with the Diagnostic Analysis of Nonverbal Accuracy 2, a self-report measure which asks participants to identify facial and vocal emotional expressions. Results revealed that the relationship between emotion recognition ability and annual income is mediated by political and interpersonal skills. This means that the better people are at recognizing emotions, the better they handle the politics in organizations and the interpersonal aspects of work life, and thus the more they earn in their jobs. The findings imply that emotional abilities enable people to be more successful at work.</p>

                      <p>This study examined how two facets of EI - emotion regulation and emotion facilitation - can shape employee creativity, an important element to driving innovation at work. The study used a multimethod (MSCEIT, experience sampling, survey) and multisource (archival, self-reported, supervisor-reported) research design of early career managers in the U.S. across a wide range of jobs. The study found that emotion regulation ability enables employees to maintain higher positive affect (e.g., excitement and enthusiasm) while emotion facilitation ability enables employees to use their positive affect to enhance their creativity, as measured by their supervisors. A sample item for creativity was: &quot;This person comes up with new and practical ideas to improve performance.&quot; The findings indicate that EI is an important variable to consider when hiring knowledge workers to produce creativity in jobs. Because EI tests exist, organizations could include these tests with other personality measures for screening purposes. Employees can also be trained to increase their abilities at managing their emotional states and responses to work requirements.</p>

                      <p>The study examines the role of EI in cross-cultural adjustment of expatriates on international assignments. Participants were 269 expatriates from a French company working in 133 countries. The independent variable, EI, was measured using SSEIT, a self-report instrument measuring appraisal, expression, regulation and utilization of emotion. The dependent variable, cross-cultural adjustment, was measured from the point of view of the expatriate based on three factors (general adjustment, interaction adjustment, and work adjustment). Cultural similarity and prior international experience were used as control variables. The results revealed a significant and positive relationship between EI and expatriates' cultural adjustment after controlling for cultural similarity and international experience. This finding suggests that it may be beneficial for organizations to leverage EI as a factor when selecting employees to go on expensive international assignments.</p>

Antecedents  of organizational engagement: exploring vision, mood and perceived  organizational support with emotional intelligence as a moderator. <em>Frontiers in Psychology</em>.  Link to full-text article: <a href="http://journal.frontiersin.org/Journal/10.3389/fpsyg.2014.01322/abstract">http://journal.frontiersin.org/Journal/10.3389/fpsyg.2014.01322/abstract</a></strong></p>
                      <p>As organizational leaders worry about the appalling low percentage of people who feel engaged in their work, academics are trying to understand what causes an increase in engagement. We collected survey data from 231 team members from two organizations. We examined the impact of team members&rsquo; emotional intelligence (EI) and their perception of shared personal vision, shared positive mood, and perceived organizational support (POS) on the members&rsquo; degree of organizational engagement. We found shared vision, shared mood, and POS have a direct, positive association with engagement. In addition, shared vision and POS interact with EI to positively influence engagement. Besides highlighting the importance of shared personal vision, positive mood, and POS, our study contributes to the emergent understanding of EI by revealing EI&rsquo;s amplifying effect on shared vision and POS in relation to engagement. We conclude by discussing the research and practical implications of this study.</p>

                      This  meta-analysis builds upon a previous meta-analysis by (1) including 65 per cent  more studies that have over twice the sample size to estimate the relationships  between emotional intelligence (EI) and job performance; (2) using more current  meta-analytical studies for estimates of relationships among personality  variables and for cognitive ability and job performance; (3) using the  three-stream approach for classifying EI research; (4) performing tests for  differences among streams of EI research and their relationships with  personality and cognitive intelligence; (5) using latest statistical procedures  such as dominance analysis; and (6) testing for publication bias. We classified  EI studies into three streams: (1) ability-based models that use objective test  items; (2) self-report or peer-report measures based on the four-branch model  of EI; and (3) ''mixed models'' of emotional competencies. The three streams  have corrected correlations ranging from 0.24 to 0.30 with job performance. The  three streams correlated differently with cognitive ability and with  neuroticism, extroversion, openness, agreeableness, and conscientiousness.  Streams 2 and 3 have the largest incremental validity beyond cognitive ability  and the Five Factor Model (FFM). Dominance analysis demonstrated that all three  streams of EI exhibited substantial relative importance in the presence of FFM  and intelligence when predicting job performance. Publication bias had  negligible influence on observed effect sizes. The results support the overall  validity of EI.</p></td>

  <strong>Emotional  and Social Intelligence Competencies: Cross Cultural Implications</strong></p>
<p>Continued research on the  assessment and development of emotional and social intelligence competencies  represents an opportunity to further both theoretical and applied applications  of behavioral science to the management of human capital. While the field has  continued to expand over the preceding decades, research has often trailed  application, especially as it relates to cross-cultural validity. The purpose  of this special issue of <em>Cross Cultural Management - An International Journal</em>  serves to focus on cultural issues related to applied use of emotional and  social intelligence competencies in diverse cultures. &nbsp;Articles in the  special issue include data from various countries including India, Peru, China,  Italy, Australia, and the United States.
