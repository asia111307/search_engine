<h1>PREFACE</h1>
<p>In the fall of 1994, the publication of Hermstein and Murray's book <cite>The 
Bell Curve</cite> sparked a new round of debate about the meaning of intelligence 
test scores and the nature of intelligence. The debate was characterized by strong 
assertions as well as by strong feelings. Unfortunately, those assertions often 
revealed serious misunderstandings of what has (and has not) been demonstrated by 
scientific research in this field. Although a great deal is now known, the issues 
remain complex and in many cases still unresolved. Another unfortunate aspect of 
the debate was that many participants made little effort to distinguish scientific 
issues from. political ones, Research findings were often assessed not so much on 
their merits or their scientific standing as on their supposed political implications. 
In such a climate. individuals who wish to make their own judgments find it hard 
to know what to believe. Reviewing the intelligence debate at its meeting of November 
1994, the Board of Scientific Affairs (BSA) of the American Psychological Association 
(APA) concluded that there was urgent need for an authoritative report on these 
issues—one that all sides could use as a basis for discussion. Acting by unanimous 
vote, BSA established a Task Force charged with preparing such a report. Ulric Neisser, 
Professor of Psychology at Emory University and a member of BSA, was appointed Chair. 
The APA Board on the Advancement of Psychology in the Public Interest (BAPPI), which 
was consulted extensively during this process, nominated one member of the Task 
Force; the Committee on Psychological Tests and Assessment nominated another; a 
third was nominated by the Council of Representatives. Other members were chosen 
by an extended consultative process, with the aim of representing a broad range 
of expertise and opinion. The Task Force met twice, in January and March of 1995. 
Between and after these meetings, drafts of the various sections were circulated, 
revised, and revised yet again. Disputes were resolved by discussion. As a result, 
the report presented here has the unanimous support of the entire Task Force. In 
July 1995, members of BSA and BAPPI were asked to comment on a preliminary draft 
of the report. Many of their helpful responses have been incorporated in this final 
version, and we are grateful for their assistance. We also wish to acknowledge the 
energetic and indispensable logistical support of the APA Science Directorate, especially 
Suzanne Wandersman and Dianne Brown. It is our hope that the result of all these 
efforts will prove to be a constructive contribution to the intelligence debate.</p>

<h2>VI. Summary and Conclusions</h2>
<h4>References</h4>
<hr />
<h1>I. CONCEPTS OF INTELLIGENCE</h1>
<p>Individuals differ from one another in their ability to understand complex ideas, 
to adapt effectively to the environment, to learn from experience, to engage in 
various forms of reasoning, to overcome obstacles by taking thought. Although these 
individual differences can be substantial, they are never entirely consistent: a 
given person's intellectual performance will vary on different occasions, in different 
domains, as judged by different criteria. Concepts of &quot;intelligence&quot; are attempts 
to clarify and organize this complex set of phenomena. Although considerable clarity 
has been achieved in some areas, no such conceptualization has yet answered all 
the important questions and none commands universal assent. Indeed, when two dozen 
prominent theorists were recently asked to define intelligence, they gave two dozen 
somewhat different definitions (Sternberg &amp; Detterman, 1986). Such disagreements 
are not cause for dismay. Scientific research rarely begins with fully agreed definitions, 
though it may eventually lead to them.</p>
<p>This first section of our report reviews the approaches to intelligence that 
are currently influential, or that seem to be becoming so. Here (as in later sections) 
much of our discussion is devoted to the dominant <span class="italic">psychometric</span> 
approach, which has not only inspired the most research and attracted the most attention 
(up to this time) but is by far the most widely used in practical settings. Nevertheless, 
other points of view deserve serious consideration. Several current theorists argue 
that there are many different &quot;intelligences&quot; (systems of abilities), only a few 
of which can be captured by standard psychometric tests. Others emphasize the role 
of culture, both in establishing different conceptions of intelligence and in influencing 
the acquisition of intellectual skills. Developmental psychologists, taking yet 
another direction, often focus more on the processes by which all children come 
to think intelligently than on measuring individual differences among them. There 
is also a new interest in the neural and biological bases of intelligence, a field 
of research that seems certain to expand in the next few years.</p>
<p>In this brief report, we cannot do full justice to even one such approach. Rather 
than trying to do so, we focus here on a limited and rather specific set of questions:
</p>
<ul>
	<li>What are the significant conceptualizations of intelligence at this time? 
	(Section I)<br />
	</li>
	<li>What do intelligence test scores mean, what do they predict, and how well 
	do they predict it? (Section II)<br />
	</li>
	<li>Why do individuals differ in intelligence, and especially in their scores 
	on intelligence tests? Our discussion of these questions implicates both genetic 
	factors (Section III) and environmental factors (Section IV).<br />
	</li>
	<li>Do various ethnic groups display different patterns of performance on intelligence 
	tests, and if so what might explain those differences? (Section V)<br />
	</li>
	<li>What significant scientific issues are presently unresolved? (Section VI)</li>
</ul>
<p>Public discussion of these issues has been especially vigorous since the 1994 
publication of Hermstein and Murray's <cite>The Bell Curve</cite>, a controversial 
volume which stimulated many equally controversial reviews and replies. Nevertheless, 
we do not directly enter that debate. Hermstein and Murray (and many of their critics) 
have gone well beyond the scientific findings, making explicit recommendations on 
various aspects of public policy. Our concern here, however, is with science rather 
than policy. The charge to our Task Force was to prepare a dispassionate survey 
of the state of the art: to make clear what has been scientifically established, 
what is presently in dispute, and what is still unknown. In fulfilling that charge, 
the only recommendations we shall make are for further research and calmer debate.</p>
<h2>The Psychometric Approach</h2>
<p>Ever since Alfred Binet's great success in devising tests to distinguish mentally 
retarded children from those with behavior problems, psychometric instruments have 
played an important part in European and American life. Tests are used for many 
purposes, such as selection, diagnosis, and evaluation. Many of the most widely 
used tests are not intended to measure intelligence itself but some closely related 
construct: scholastic aptitude, school achievement, specific abilities, etc. Such 
tests are especially important for selection purposes. For preparatory school, it's 
the SSAT; for college, the SAT or ACT; for graduate school, the GRE; for medical 
school, the MOAT; for law school, the LSAT; for business school, the GMAT. Scores 
on intelligence-related tests matter, and the stakes can be high.</p>
<p><strong>Intelligence tests.</strong> Tests of intelligence itself (in the psychometric 
sense) come in many forms. Some use only a single type of item or question; examples 
include the Peabody Picture Vocabulary Test (a measure of children's verbal intelligence) 
and Raven's Progressive Matrices (a nonverbal, untimed test that requires inductive 
reasoning about perceptual patterns). Although such instruments are useful for specific 
purposes, the more familiar measures of general intelligence, such as the Wechsler 
tests and the Stanford-Binet, include many different types of items, both verbal 
and nonverbal. Test-takers may be asked to give the meanings of words, to complete 
a series of pictures, to indicate which of several words does not belong with the 
others, and the like. Their performance can then be scored to yield several subscores 
as well as an overall score.</p>
<p>By convention, overall intelligence test scores are usuallv converted to a scale 
in which the mean is 100 and the standard deviation is 15. (The standard deviation 
is a measure of the variability of the distribution of scores.) Approximately 95% 
of the population has scores within two standard deviations of the mean, i.e. between 
70 and 130. For historical reasons, the term &quot;IQ&quot; is often used to describe scores 
on tests of intelligence. It originally referred to an &quot;intelligence Quotient&quot; that 
was formed by dividing a so-called mental age by a chronological age, but this procedure 
is no longer used.</p>
<p><strong>Intercorrelations among Tests.</strong> Individuals rarely perform equally 
well on all the different kinds of items included in a test of intelligence. One 
person may do relatively better on verbal than on spatial items, for example, while 
another may show the opposite pattern. Nevertheless, subtests measuring different 
abilities tend to be positively correlated: people who score high on one such subtest 
are likely to be above average on others as well. These complex patterns of correlation 
can be clarified by factor analysis, but the results of such analyses are often 
controversial themselves. Some theorists (e.g., Spearman, 1927) have emphasized 
the importance of a general factor, g, which represents what all the tests have 
in common; others (e.g., Thurstone, 1938) focus on more specific group factors such 
as memory, verbal comprehension, or number facility. As we shall see in Section 
2, one common view today envisages something like a hierarchy of factors with g 
at the apex. But there is no full agreement on what g actually means: it has been 
described as a mere statistical regularity (Thompson, 1939), a kind of mental energy 
(Spearman, 1927), a generalized abstract reasoning ability (Gustafsson 1984), or 
an index measure of neural processing speed (Reed &amp; Jensen, 1992).</p>
<p>There have been many disputes over the utility of IQ and g. Some theorists are 
critical of the entire psychometric approach (e.g., Ceci, 1990; Gardner, 1983; Gould, 
1978), while others regard it as firmly established (e.g., Carroll, 1993; Eysenck, 
1973; Hermstein &amp; Murray, 1994; Jensen, 1972). The critics do not dispute the stability 
of test scores, nor the fact that they predict certain forms of achievement—especially 
school achievement—rather effectively (see Section 2). They do argue, however, that 
to base a concept of intelligence on test scores alone is to ignore many important 
aspects of mental ability. Some of those aspects are emphasized in other approaches 
reviewed below.</p>
<h2>Multiple Forms of Intelligence</h2>
<p><strong>Gardner's Theory.</strong> A relatively new approach is the theory of 
&quot;multiple intelligences&quot;; proposed by Howard Gardner (1983). On this view conceptions 
of intelligence should be informed not only by work with normal children and adults 
but also by studies of gifted individuals (including so-called 'savants&quot;), of persons 
who have suffered brain damage, of experts and virtuosos, and of individuals from 
diverse cultures. These considerations have led Gardner to include musical, bodlily-kinesthetic, 
and various forms of personal intelligence as well as more familiar spatial, linguistic, 
and logical mathematical abilities in the scope of his theory. He argues that psychometric 
tests address only linguistic and logical plus some aspects of spatial intelligence; 
other forms have been entirely ignored. Moreover, the paper-and-pencil format of 
most tests rules out many kinds of intelligent performance that matter in everyday 
life, such as giving an extemporaneous talk (linguistic) or being able to find one's 
way in a new town (spatial). While Gardner's arguments have attracted considerable 
interest, the stability and validity of performance tests in these new domains has 
yet to be conclusively demonstrated. It is also possible to doubt whether some of 
these abilities—bodily-kinesthetic,&quot; for example—are appropriately described as 
forms of intelligence rather than as special talents.</p>
<p><strong>Sternberg's Theory.</strong> Robert Sternberg's (1985) triarchic theory 
proposes three fundamental aspects of intelligence—analytic, creative, and practical—of 
which only the first is measured to any significant extent by mainstream tests. 
His investigations suggest the need for a balance between analytic intelligence, 
on the one hand, and creative and especially practical intelligence on the other. 
The distinction between analytic (or &quot;academic&quot;) and practical intelligence has 
also been made by others (e.g., Neisser, 1976). Analytic problems, of the type suitable 
for test construction, tend to (a) have been formulated by other people, (b) be 
clearly defined, (c) come with all the information needed to solve them, (d) have 
only a single right answer, which can be reached by only a single method, (e) be 
disembodied from ordinary experience, and (f) have little or no intrinsic interest. 
Practical problems, in contrast, tend to (a) require problem recognition and formulation, 
(b) be poorly defined, (c) require information seeking, (d) have various acceptable 
solutions, (e) be embedded in and require prior everyday experience, and (f) require 
motivation and personal involvement.</p>
<p>As part of their study of practical intelligence, Sternberg and his collaborators 
have developed measures of &quot;<span class="italic">tacit knowledge</span>&quot; in various 
domains, especially business management. In these measures, individuals are given 
written scenarios of various work related situations and then asked to rank a number 
of options for dealing with the situation presented. The results show that tacit 
knowledge predicts such criteria such as job performance fairly well, even though 
it is relatively independent of intelligence test scores and other common selection 
measures (Sternberg &amp; Wagner, 1993; Sternberg, Wagner, Williams &amp; Horvath, in press). 
This work, too, has its critics (Jensen, 1993; Schmidt &amp; Hunter, 1993).</p>
<p><strong>Related Findings.</strong> Other investigators have also demonstrated 
the relative independence of academic and practical intelligence. Brazilian street 
children, for example, are quite capable of doing the math required for survival 
in their street business even though they have failed mathematics in school (Carraher, 
Carraher, and Schliemann, 1985). Similarly, women shoppers in California who had 
no difficulty in comparing product values at the supermarket were unable to carry 
out the same mathematical operations in paper-and-pencil tests (Lave, 1988). In 
a study of expertise in wagering on harness races, Ceci and Liker (1986) found that 
the skilled handicappers implicitly used a highly complex interactive model with 
as many as seven variables; the ability to do this successfully was unrelated to 
scores on intelligence tests.</p>
<h2>Cultural Variation</h2>
<p>It is very difficult to compare concepts of intelligence across cultures. English 
is not alone in having many words for different aspects of intellectual power and 
cognitive skill (<span class="italic">wise, sensible, smart, bright, clever; cunning, 
etc.</span>); if another language has just as many, which of them shall we say corresponds 
to its speakers' &quot;concept of intelligence&quot;? The few attempts to examine this issue 
directly have typically found that, even within a given society, different cognitive 
characteristics are emphasized from one situation to another and from one subculture 
to another(Serpell, 1974; Super, 1983; Wober, 1974). These differences extend not 
just to conceptions of intelligence but to what is considered adaptive or appropriate 
in a broader sense.</p>
<p>These issues have occasionally been addressed across sub-cultures and ethnic 
groups in America. In a study conducted in San Jose California, Okagaki and Sternberg 
(1993) asked immigrant parents from Cambodia, Mexico, the Philippines and Vietnam, 
as well as native-born Anglo-Americans and Mexican-Americans, about their conceptions 
of child-rearing, appropriate teaching, and children's intelligence. Parents from 
all groups except Anglo-Americans indicated that such characteristics as motivation, 
social skills, and practical school skills were as or more important than cognitive 
characteristics for their conceptions of an intelligent first-grade child.</p>
<p>Heath (1983) found that different ethnic groups in North Carolina have different 
conceptions of intelligence. To be considered as intelligent or adaptive, one must 
excel in the skills valued by one's own group. One particularly interesting contrast 
was in the importance ascribed to verbal vs. nonverbal communication skills—to saying 
things explicitly as opposed to using and understanding gestures and facial expressions. 
Note that while both these forms of communicative skill have their uses, they are 
not equally well represented in psychometric tests.</p>
<p>How testing is done can have different effects in different cultural groups. 
This can happen for many reasons, including differential familiarity with the test 
materials themselves. Serpell (1979), for example, asked Zambian and English children 
to reproduce patterns in three media: wire models, clay models, or pencil and paper. 
The Zambian children excelled in the wire medium with which they were familiar, 
while the English children were best with pencil and paper. Both groups performed 
equally well with clay.</p>
<h2>Developmental Progressions</h2>
<p><strong>Piaget's Theory.</strong> The best-known developmentally-based conception 
of intelligence is certainly that of the Swiss psychologist Jean Piaget (1972). 
Unlike most of the theorists considered here, Piaget had relatively little interest 
in individual differences. Intelligence develops in all children through the continually 
shifting balance between the assimilation of new information into existing cognitive 
structures and the accommodation of those structures themselves to the new information. 
To index the development of intelligence in this sense, Piaget devised methods that 
are rather different from conventional tests. To assess the understanding of &quot;conservation.&quot; 
for example, (roughly, the principle that material quantity is not affected by mere 
changes of shape), children who have watched water being poured from a shallow to 
a tall beaker may be asked if there is now more water than before. (A positive answer 
would suggest that the child has not yet mastered the principle of conservation.) 
Piaget's tasks can be modified to serve as measures of individual differences; when 
this is done, they correlate fairly well with standard psychometric tests (for a 
review see Jensen, 1980).</p>
<p><strong>Vygotsky's Theory.</strong> The Russian psychologist Lev Vygotsky (1978) 
argued that all intellectual abilities are social in origin. Language and thought 
first appear in early interactions with parents, and continue to develop through 
contact with teachers and others. Traditional intelligence tests ignore what Vygotsky 
called the &quot;zone of proximal development.&quot; i.e., the level of performance that a 
child might reach with appropriate help from a supportive adult. Such tests are 
&quot;static.&quot; measuring only the intelligence that is already fully developed. &quot;Dynamic&quot; 
testing, in which the examiner provides guided and graded feedback, can go further 
to give some indication of the child's latent potential. These ideas are being developed 
and extended by a number of contemporary psychologists (Brown &amp; French, 1979; Feuerstein, 
1980; Pascual-Leone &amp; Ijaz, 1989).</p>
<h2>Biological Approaches</h2>
<p>Some investigators have recently turned to the study of the brain as a basis 
for new ideas about what intelligence is and how to measure it. Many aspects of 
brain anatomy and physiology have been suggested as potentially relevant to intelligence: 
the arborization of cortical neurons (Ceci, 1990), cerebral glucose metabolism (Haier 
1993), evoked potentials (Caryl, 1994), nerve conduction velocity (Reed &amp; Jensen, 
1992), sex hormones (see Section 4), and still others (cf. Vernon, 1993). Advances 
in research methods, including new forms of brain imaging such as PET and MRI scans, 
will surely add to this list. In the not-too-distant future it may be possible to 
relate some aspects of test performance to specific characteristics of brain function.</p>
<p>This brief survey has revealed a wide range of contemporary conceptions of intelligence 
and of how it should be measured. The psychometric approach is the oldest and best 
established, but others also have much to contribute. We should be open to the possibility 
that our understanding of intelligence in the future will be rather different from 
what it is today.</p>
<hr />
<h1>II INTELLIGENCE TESTS AND THEIR CORRELATES</h1>
<p>The correlation coefficient, r, can be computed whenever the scores in a sample 
are paired in some way. Typically this is because each individual is measured twice: 
he or she takes the same test on two occasions, or takes two different tests, or 
has both a test score and some criterion measure such as grade point average or 
job performance. (In Section 3 we consider cases where the paired scores are those 
of two different individuals, such as twins or parent and child.) The value of r 
measures the degree of relationship between the two sets of scores in a convenient 
way, by assessing how well one of them (computationally it doesn't matter which 
one) could be used to predict the value of the other. Its sign indicates the direction 
of relationship: when r is negative, high scores on one measure predict low scores 
on the other. Its magnitude indicates the strength of the relationship. If r=0, 
there is no relation at all; if r is 1 (or -1), one score can be used to predict 
the other score perfectly. Moreover, the square of r has a particular meaning in 
cases where we are concerned with predicting one variable from another. When r=.50, 
for example, r<sup>2</sup> is .25: this means (given certain linear assumptions) 
that 25% of the variance in one set of scores is predictable from the correlated 
values of the other set, while the remaining 75% is not.</p>
<h2>Basic Characteristics of Test Scores</h2>
<p><strong>Stability.</strong> Intelligence test scores are fairly stable during 
development. When Jones and Bayley (1941) tested a sample of children annually throughout 
childhood and adolescence, for example, scores obtained at age 18 were correlated 
r=.77 with scores that had been obtained at age 6, r=.89 with scores from age 12. 
When scores were averaged across several successive tests to remove short-term fluctuations, 
the correlations were even higher. The mean for ages 17 and 18 was correlated r=.86 
with the mean for ages 5, 6 and 7, r=.96 with the mean for ages 11, 12 and 13. (For 
comparable findings in a more recent study, see Moffitt, Caspi, Harkness, &amp; Silva, 
1993.) Nevertheless, IQ scores do change over time. In the same study (Jones &amp; Bayley, 
1941), the average change between age 12 and age 17 was 7.1 IQ points; some individuals 
changed as much as 18 points.</p>
<p>Is it possible to measure the intelligence of young infants in a similar way? 
Conventional tests of &quot;infant intelligence&quot; do not predict later test scores very 
well, but certain experimental measures of infant attention and memory that were 
originally developed for other purposes have turned out to be more successful. In 
the most common procedure, a particular visual pattern is shown to a baby over and 
over again. The experimenter records how long the infant subject looks at the pattern 
on each trial; these looks get shorter and shorter as the baby becomes &quot;habituated&quot; 
to it. The time required to reach a certain level of habituation, or the extent 
to which the baby now &quot;prefers&quot; (looks longer at) a new pattern, are regarded as 
measures of some aspect of his or her information-processing capability.</p>
<p>These habituation-based measures, obtained from babies at ages ranging from three 
months to a year, are significantly correlated with the intelligence test scores 
of the same children when they get to be 2 or 4 or 6 years old (for reviews see 
Bornstein, 1989; Columbo, 1993; McCall &amp; Garriger, 1993). A few studies have found 
such correlations even at ages 8 or 11 (Rose &amp; Feldman, 1995). A recent meta analysis, 
based on 31 different samples, estimates the average magnitude of the correlations 
at about r=.36 (McCall &amp; Ganriger, 1993). (The largest rs often appear in samples 
that include 'at risk' infants.) It is possible that these habituation scores (and 
other similar measures of infant cognition) do indeed reflect real cognitive differences, 
perhaps in 'speed of information processing&quot; (Colombo, 1993). It is also possible, 
however, that—to a presently unknown extent—they reflect early differences in temperament 
or inhibition.</p>
<p>It is important to understand what remains stable and what changes in the development 
of intelligence. A child whose IQ score remains the same from age 6 to age 18 does 
not exhibit the same performance throughout that period. On the contrary, steady 
gains in general knowledge vocabulary, reasoning ability, etc. will be apparent. 
What does <span class="italic">not</span> change is his or her score in comparison 
to that of other individuals of the same age. A six-year old with an IQ of 100 is 
at the mean of six-year-olds; an 11-year-old with that score is at the mean of 18-year-olds.</p>
<p><strong>Factors and g.</strong> As noted in Section 1, the patterns of intercorrelation 
among tests (i.e. among different kinds of items) are complex. Some pairs of tests 
are much more closely related than others, but all such correlations are typically 
positive and form what is called a &quot;positive manifold.&quot; Spearman (1927) showed that 
in any such manifold, some portion of the variance of scores on each test can be 
mathematically attributed to a &quot;general factor.&quot; or g. Given this analysis, the 
overall pattern of correlations can be roughly described as produced by individual 
differences in g plus differences in the specific abilities sampled by particular 
tests. In addition, however, there are usually patterns of intercorrelation among 
groups of tests. These commonalities, which played only a small role in Spearman's 
analysis, were emphasized by other theorists. Thurstone (1938), for example, proposed 
an analysis based primarily on the concept of group factors.</p>
<p>While some psychologists today still regard g as the most fundamental measure 
of intelligence (e.g., Jensen, 1980), others prefer to emphasize the distinctive 
profile of strengths and weaknesses present in each person's performance. A recently 
published review identifies over 70 different abilities that can be distinguished 
by currently available tests (Carroll, 1993). One way to represent this structure 
is in terms of a hierarchical arrangement with a general intelligence factor at 
the apex and various more specialized abilities arrayed below it. Such a summary 
merely acknowledges that performance levels on different tests are correlated; it 
is consistent with, but does not prove, the hypothesis that a common factor such 
as g underlies those correlations. Different specialized abilities might also be 
correlated for other reasons, such as the effects of education. Thus while the g-based 
factor hierarchy is the most widely accepted current view of the structure of abilities, 
some theorists regard it as misleading (Ceci, 1990). Moreover, as noted in Section 
1, a wide range of human abilities, including many that seem to have intellectual 
components, are outside the domain of standard psychometric tests.</p>
<h2>Tests as Predictors</h2>
<p><strong>School Performance.</strong> Intelligence tests were originally devised 
by Alfred Binet to measure children's ability to succeed in school. They do in fact 
predict school performance fairly well: the correlation between IQ scores and grades 
is about .50. They also predict scores on school achievement tests, designed to 
measure knowledge of the curriculum. Note, however, that correlations of this magnitude 
account for only about 25% of the overall variance. Successful school learning depends 
on many personal characteristics other than intelligence, such as persistence, interest 
in school, and willingness to study. The encouragement for academic achievement 
that is received from peers, family and teachers may also be important, together 
with more general cultural factors (see Section 5).</p>
<p>The relationship between test scores and school performance seems to be ubiquitous. 
Wherever it has been studied, children with high scores on tests of intelligence 
tend to learn more of what is taught in school than their lower-scoring peers. There 
may be styles of teaching and methods of instruction that will decrease or increase 
this correlation, but none that consistently eliminates it has yet been found (Cronbach 
and Snow, 1977).</p>
<p>What children learn in school depends not only on their individual abilities 
but also on teaching practices and on what is actually taught. Recent comparisons 
among pupils attending school in different countries have made this especially obvious. 
Children in Japan and China, for example, know a great deal more math than American 
children even though their intelligence test scores are quite similar (see Section 
5). This difference may result from many factors, including cultural attitudes toward 
schooling as well as the sheer amount of time devoted to the study of mathematics 
and how that study is organized (Stevenson &amp; Stigler, 1992). In principle it is 
quite possible to improve the school learning of American children—even very substantially—without 
changing their intelligence test scores at all.</p>
<p><strong>Years of Education.</strong> Some children stay in school longer than 
others; many go on to college and perhaps beyond. Two variables that can be measured 
as early as elementary school correlate with the total amount of education individuals 
will obtain: test scores and social class background. Correlations between IQ scores 
and total years of education are about .55, implying that differences in psychometric 
intelligence account for about 30% of the outcome variance. The correlations of 
years of education with social class background (as indexed by the occupation/ education 
of a child's parents) are also positive, but somewhat lower.</p>
<p>There are a number of reasons why children with higher test scores tend to get 
more education. They are likely to get good grades, and to be encouraged by teachers 
and counselors; often they are placed in &quot;college preparatory&quot; classes, where they 
make friends who may also encourage them. In general, they are likely to find the 
process of education rewarding in a way that many low-scoring children do not (Rehberg 
and Rosenthal, 1978). These influences are not omnipotent: some high scoring children 
do drop out of school. Many personal and social characteristics other than psychometric 
intelligence determine academic success and interest, and social privilege may also 
play a role. Nevertheless, test scores are the best single predictor of an individual's 
years of education.</p>
<p>In contemporary American society, the amount of schooling that adults complete 
is also somewhat predictive of their social status. Occupations considered high 
in prestige (e.g., law, medicine, even corporate business) usually require at least 
a college degree—16 or more years of education—as a condition of entry. It is partly 
because intelligence test scores predict years of education so well that they also 
predict occupational status, and even income to a smaller extent, (Jencks, 1979). 
Moreover, many occupations can only be entered through professional schools which 
base their admissions at least partly on test scores: the MCAT, the GMAT, the LSAT, 
etc. Individual scores on admission-related tests such as these are certainly correlated 
with scores on tests of intelligence.</p>
<p><strong>Social Status and Income.</strong> How well do IQ scores (which can be 
obtained before individuals enter the labor force) predict such outcome measures 
as the social status or income of adults? This question is complex, in part because 
another variable also predicts such outcomes: namely, the socioeconomic status (SES) 
of one's parents. Unsurprisingly, children of privileged families are more likely 
to attain high social status than those whose parents are poor and less educated. 
These two predictors (IQ and parental SES) are by no means independent of one another; 
the correlation between them is around .33 (White, 1982).</p>
<p>One way to look at these relationships is to begin with SES. According to Jencks 
(1979), measures of parental SES predict about one-third of the variance in young 
adults' social status and about one-fifth of the variance in their income. About 
half of this predictive effectiveness depends on the fact that the SES of parents 
also predicts children's intelligence test scores, which have their own predictive 
value for social outcomes; the other half comes about in other ways.</p>
<p>We can also begin with IQ scores, which by themselves account for about one-fourth 
of the social status variance and one-sixth of the income variance. Statistical 
controls for parental SES eliminate only about a quarter of this predictive power. 
One way to conceptualize this effect is by comparing the occupational status (or 
income) of adult brothers who grew up in the same family and hence have the same 
parental SES. In such cases, the brother with the higher adolescent IQ score is 
likely to have the higher adult social status and income (Jencks, 1979). This effect, 
in turn, is substantially mediated by education: the brother with the higher test 
scores is likely to get more schooling, and hence to be better credentialled as 
he enters the workplace.</p>
<p>Do these data imply that psychometric intelligence is a major determinant of 
social status or income? That depends on what one means by major. In fact, individuals 
who have the same test scores may differ widely in occupational status and even 
more widely in income. Consider for a moment the distribution of occupational status 
scores for all individuals in a population, and then consider the conditional distribution 
of such scores for just those individuals who test at some given IQ. Jencks (1979) 
notes that the standard deviation of the latter distribution may still be quite 
large; in some cases it amounts to about 88% of the standard deviation for the entire 
population. Viewed from this perspective, psychometric intelligence appears as only 
one of a great many factors that influence social outcomes.</p>
<p><strong>Job Performance.</strong> Scores on intelligence tests predict various 
measures of job performance: supervisor ratings, work samples, etc. Such correlations, 
which typically lie between r=.30 and r=.50, are partly restricted by the limited 
reliability of those measures themselves. They become higher when ris statistically 
corrected for this unreliability: in one survey of relevant studies (Hunter, 1983), 
the mean of the corrected correlations was .54. This implies that, across a wide 
range of occupations, intelligence test performance accounts for some 29% of the 
variance in job performance.</p>
<p>Although these correlations can sometimes be modified by changing methods of 
training or aspects of the job itself, intelligence test scores are at least weakly 
related to job performance in most settings. Sometimes IQ scores are described as 
the 'best available predictor&quot; of that performance. It is worth noting, however, 
that such tests predict considerably less than half the variance of job-related 
measures. Other individual characteristics such as interpersonal skills, aspects 
of personality, etc., are probably of equal or greater importance, but at this point 
we do not have equally reliable instruments to measure them.</p>
<p><strong>Social Outcomes.</strong> Psychometric intelligence is negatively correlated 
with certain socially undesirable outcomes. For example, children with high test 
scores are less likely than lower-scoring children to engage in juvenile crime. 
in one study, Moffitt, Gabrielli, Mednick &amp; Schulsinger (1981) found a correlation 
of -.19 between IQ scores and number of juvenile offenses in a large Danish sample; 
with social class controlled, the correlation dropped to -. 17. The correlations 
for most &quot;negative outcome&quot; variables are typically smaller than .20, which means 
that test scores are associated with less than 4% of their total variance. It is 
important to realize that the causal links between psychometric ability and social 
outcomes may be indirect. Children who are unsuccessful in—and hence alienated from—school 
may be more likely to engage in delinquent behaviors for that very reason, compared 
to other children who enjoy school and are doing well.</p>
<p>In summary, intelligence test scores predict a wide range of social outcomes 
with varying degrees of success. Correlations are highest for school achievement, 
where they account for about a quarter of the variance. They are somewhat lower 
for job performance, and very low for negatively valued outcomes such as criminality. 
In general, intelligence tests measure only some of the many personal characteristics 
that are relevant to life in contemporary America. Those characteristics are never 
the only influence on outcomes, though in the case of school performance they may 
well be the strongest.</p>
<h2>Test Scores and Measures of Processing Speed</h2>
<p>Many recent studies show that the speeds with which people perform very simple 
perceptual and cognitive tasks are correlated with psychometric intelligence (for 
reviews see Ceci, 1990; Deary, 1995; Vernon, 1987). In general, people with higher 
intelligence test scores apprehend, scan, retrieve, and respond to stimuli more 
quickly than those who score lower.</p>
<p><strong>Cognitive Correlates.</strong> The modern study of these relations began 
in the 1970s, as part of the general growth of interest in chronometric measures 
of cognition. Many of the new cognitive paradigms required subjects to make same/different 
judgments or other types of speeded responses to visual displays. Although those 
paradigms had not been devised with individual differences in mind, they could be 
interpreted as providing measures of the speed of certain information processes. 
Those speeds turned out to correlate with psychometrically-measured verbal ability 
(Hunt, 1978; Jackson &amp; McClelland, 1979). In some problem solving tasks, it was 
possible to analyze the subjects' overall response times into theoretically motivated 
'cognitive components&quot; (Sternberg, 1977); component times could then be correlated 
with test scores in their own right.</p>
<p>Although the size of these correlations was modest (seldom accounting for more 
than 10% of the variance), they did increase as the basic tasks were made more complex 
by requiring increased memory or attentional capacity. For instance, the correlation 
between paired associate learning and intelligence increased as the pairs were presented 
at faster rates (Christal et al., 1984).</p>
<p><strong>Choice Reaction Time.</strong> In another popular cognitive paradigm, 
the subject simply moves his or her finger from a 'home&quot; button to one of eight 
others arranged in a semicircle around it; these are marked by small lights that 
indicate which one is the target on a given trial (Jensen, 1987). Various aspects 
of the choice reaction times obtained in this paradigm are correlated with scores 
on intelligence tests, sometimes with values of r as high as .30 or -.40 (r is negative 
because higher test scores go with shorter times). Nevertheless it has proved difficult 
to make theoretical sense of the overall pattern of correlations, and the results 
obtained in this paradigm are still hard to interpret (cf. Longstreth, 1984; Brody, 
1992). A later modification, the 'odd-man-out&quot; procedure of Frearson and Eysenck 
(1986), seems to be more promising.</p>
<p><strong>Inspection Time.</strong> A more recently developed measure of processing 
speed, which seems relatively independent of response factors, is the method of 
&quot;inspection time&quot; (IT). In the standard version of this paradigm (Vickers, Nettelbeck 
&amp; Wilson, 1972; Nettelbeck, 1987), two vertical lines are shown very briefly on 
each trial, followed by a pattern mask; the subject must judge which line was shorter. 
For a given subject, IT is defined as the minimum exposure duration (up to the onset 
of the mask) for which the lines must be displayed if he or she is to meet a preestablished 
criterion of accuracy—e.g., nine correct trials out of ten.</p>
<p>Inspection times defined in this way are consistently correlated with measures 
of psychometric intelligence. In a recent meta-analysis, Kranzler and Jensen (1989) 
reported an overall correlation of -.30 between IQ scores and IT; this rose to -.55 
when corrected for measurement error and attenuation. More recent findings confirm 
this general result (e.g., Bates &amp; Eysenck, 1993, Deary, 1993). IT usually correlates 
best with performance subtests of intelligence; its correlation with verbal intelligence 
is usually weaker and sometimes zero.</p>
<p>One apparent advantage of IT over other chronometric methods is that the task 
itself seems particularly simple. At first glance, it is hard to imagine that any 
differences in response strategies or stimulus familiarity could affect the outcome. 
Nevertheless, it seems that they do. Brian Mackenzie and his colleagues (e.g. Mackenzie 
et al, 1991) discovered that some subjects use apparent-movement cues in the basic 
IT task while others do not; only in the latter group is IT correlated with intelligence 
test scores. Moreover, standard IT paradigms require an essentially spatial judgment; 
it is not surprising, then, that they correlate with intelligence tests which emphasize 
spatial ability. With this in mind, Mackenzie et al (1991) devised a verbal inspection 
time task based on Posner's classical same-letter/different-letter paradigm (Posner 
et al, 1969). As predicted, the resulting ITs correlated with verbal but not with 
spatial intelligence. It is clear that the apparently simple IT task actually involves 
complex modes of information processing (cf. Chaiken, 1993) that are as yet poorly 
understood.</p>
<p><strong>Neurological Measures.</strong> Recent research has begun to explore 
what seem to be still more direct measures of neural processing. Reed and Jensen 
(1992) have used visual evoked potential (VEP) techniques to assess what they call 
&quot;nerve conduction velocity&quot; (NCV). To estimate this velocity, each subject's head 
length (a rough index of the distance between the eye and the occipital cortex) 
is divided by the mean latency of an early component (N70 or P100) in his or her 
VEP pattern. In a study with 147 college-student subjects, this measure correlated 
r =.26 with scores on an unspeeded test of intelligence. (A statistical correction 
for the restricted subject range raised the correlation to r = .37.) Other researchers 
have also reported correlations between VEP parameters and intelligence test scores 
(Caryl, 1994). Interestingly, however, the same &quot;conduction velocities&quot; were
<span class="italic">not</span> correlated with the same subjects' choice reaction 
times (Reed &amp; Jensen, 1993). Other researchers have also reported correlations between 
VEP parameters and intelligence test scores (Caryl, 1994).</p>
<p><strong>Problems of lnterpretation.</strong> Some researchers believe that psychometric 
intelligence, especially g, depends directly on the 'neural efficiency&quot; of the brain 
(Vernon, 1987; Eysenck, 1986). They regard the observed correlations between test 
scores and measures of processing speed as evidence for their view. If choice reaction 
times, inspection times, and VEP latencies actually reflect the speed of basic neural 
processes, such correlations are only to be expected. In fact, however, the observed 
patterns of correlation are rarely as simple as this hypothesis would predict. Moreover, 
it is quite possible that high- and low-IQ individuals differ in other ways that 
affect speeded performance (cf. Ceci, 1990). Those variables include motivation, 
response criteria (emphasis on speed vs. accuracy), perceptual strategies (cf. Mackenzie 
et al, 1991), attentional strategies, and in some cases differential familiarity 
with the material itself. Finally, we do not know the direction of causation that 
underlies many of these correlations. Do high levels of neural efficiency&quot; promote 
the development of intelligence, or do more intelligent people just find faster 
ways to carry out perceptual tasks? Or both? These questions are still open.</p>
<hr />
<h1>III. THE GENES AND INTELLIGENCE</h1>
<p>In this section of the report we first discuss individual differences generally, 
without reference to any particular trait. We then focus on intelligence, as measured 
by conventional IQ tests or other tests intended to measure general cognitive ability. 
The different and more controversial topic of group differences will be considered 
in Section V.</p>
<p>We focus here on the relative contributions of genes and environments to individual 
differences in particular traits. To avoid misunderstanding, it must be emphasized 
from the outset that gene action always involves an environment—at least a biochemical 
environment, and often an ecological one. (For humans, that ecology is usually interpersonal 
or cultural.) Thus all genetic effects on the development of observable traits are 
potentially modifiable by environmental input, though the practicability of making 
such modifications may be another matter. Conversely, all environmental effects 
on trait development involve the genes or structures to which the genes have contributed. 
Thus there is always a genetic aspect to the effects of the environment (cf. Plomin 
&amp; Bergeman, 1991).</p>
<h2>Sources of Individual Differences</h2>
<p><strong>Partitioning the Variation.</strong> Individuals differ from one another 
on a wide variety of traits: familiar examples include height. intelligence, and 
aspects of personality. Those differences are often of considerable social importance. 
Many interesting questions can be asked about their nature and origins. One such 
question is the extent to which they reflect differences among the genes of the 
individuals involved, as distinguished from differences among the environments to 
which those individuals have been exposed. The issue here is not whether genes and 
environments are both essential for the development of a given trait (this is always 
the case), and it is not about the genes or environment of any particular person. 
We are concerned only with the observed variation of the trait across individuals 
in a given population. A figure called the &quot;heritability&quot; (h<sup>2</sup>) of the 
trait represents the proportion of that variation that is associated with genetic 
differences among the individuals. The remaining variation (1—h<sup>2</sup>] is 
associated with environmental differences and with errors of measurement. These 
proportions can be estimated by various methods described below.</p>
<p>Sometimes special interest attaches to those aspects of environments that family 
members have in common (for example, characteristics of the home). The part of the 
variation that derives from this source, called &quot;shared&quot; variation or c<sup>2</sup>, 
can also be estimated. Still more refined estimates can be made: c<sup>2</sup> is 
sometimes subdivided into several kinds of shared variation; h<sup>2</sup> is sometimes 
subdivided into so-called &quot;additive&quot; and &quot;non-additive&quot; portions /the part that 
is transmissible from parent to child vs. the part expressed anew in each generation 
by a unique patterning of genes.) Variation associated with correlations and statistical 
interactions between genes and environments may also be identifiable. In theory, 
any of the above estimates may vary with the age of the individuals involved.</p>
<p>A high heritability does not mean that the environment has no impact on the development 
of a trait, or that learning is not involved. Vocabulary size, for example, is very 
substantially heritable (and highly correlated with general intelligence) although 
every word in an individual's vocabulary is learned. In a society in which plenty 
of words are available in everyone's environment, especially for individuals who 
are motivated to seek them out, the number of words that individuals actually learn 
depends to a considerable extent on their genetic predispositions.</p>
<p>Behavior geneticists have often emphasized the fact that individuals can be active 
in creating or selecting their own environments. Some describe this process as active 
or reactive genotype-environment correlation (Plomin, DeFries, &amp; Loehlin, 1977). 
(The distinction is between the action of the organism in selecting its own environment 
and the reaction of others to its gene-based traits.) Others suggest that these 
forms of gene-environment relationship are typical of the way that genes are normally 
expressed, and simply include them as part of the genetic effect (Roberts, 1967). 
This is a matter of terminological preference, not a dispute about facts.</p>
<p><strong>How Genetic Estimates are Made.</strong> Estimates of the magnitudes 
of these sources of individual differences are made by exploiting natural and social 
'experiments&quot; that combine genotypes and environments in informative ways. Monozygotic 
(MZ) and dyzygotic (DZ) twins, for example, can be regarded as experiments of nature. 
MZ twins are paired individuals of the same age growing up in the same family who 
have all their genes in common; DZ twins are otherwise similar pairs who have only 
half their genes in common. Adoptions, in contrast, are experiments of society. 
They allow one to compare genetically unrelated persons who are growing up in the 
same family as well as genetically related persons who are growing up in different 
families. They can also provide information about genotype-environment correlations: 
in ordinary families genes and environments are correlated because the same parents 
provide both, whereas in adoptive families one set of parents provides the genes 
and another the environment. An experiment involving both nature and society is 
the study of monozygotic twins who have been reared apart (Bouchard, Lykken, McGue, 
Segal &amp; Tellegen, 1990; Pedersen, Plomin, Nesselroade &amp; McClearn, 1992). Relationships 
in the families of monozygotic twins also offer unique possibilities for analysis 
(e.g., Rose, Harris, Christian, &amp; Nance, 1979). Because these comparisons are subject 
to different sources of potential error, the results of studies involving several 
kinds of kinship are often analyzed together to arrive at robust overall conclusions. 
(For general discussions of behavior genetic methods, see Plomin, DeFries, &amp; McClearn, 
1990, or Hay, 1985.)</p>
<h2>Results for IQ scores</h2>
<p><strong>Parameter Estimates.</strong> Across the ordinary range of environments 
in modern Western societies, a sizable part of the variation in intelligence test 
scores is associated with genetic differences among individuals. Quantitative estimates 
vary from one study to another, because many are based on small or selective samples. 
If one simply combines all available correlations in a single analysis, the heritability 
(h<sup>2</sup>) works out to about .50 and the between-family variance (c<sup>2</sup>) 
to about .25 (e.g., Chipuer, Rovine, &amp; Plomin, 1990; Loehlin, 1989). These overall 
figures are misleading, however, because most of the relevant studies have been 
done with children. We now know that the heritability of IQ changes with age: h<sup>2</sup> 
goes up and c<sup>2</sup> goes down from infancy to adulthood (McCartney, Harris, 
&amp; Bernieri, 1990; McGue, Bouchard, Iacono, &amp; Lykken, 1993). In childhood h<sup>2</sup> 
and C<sup>2</sup> for IQ are of the order of .45 and .35; by late adolescence h<sup>2</sup> 
is around .75 and c<sup>2</sup> is quite low (zero in some studies). Substantial 
environmental variance remains, but it primarily reflects within-family rather than 
between-family differences.</p>
<p>These adult parameter estimates are based on a number of independent studies. 
The correlation between MZ twins reared apart, which directly estimates h<sup>2</sup>, 
ranged from .68 to .78 in five studies involving adult samples from Europe and the 
U.S. (McGue et al., 1993). The correlation between unrelated children reared together 
in adoptive families, which directly estimates c<sup>2</sup>, was approximately 
zero for adolescents in two adoption studies (Scarr &amp; Weinberg, 1978; Loehlin, Horn, 
&amp; Willerman, 1989) and .19 in a third (the Minnesota transracial adoption study: 
Scarr, Weinberg &amp; Waldman, 1993).</p>
<p>These particular estimates derive from samples in which the lowest socioeconomic 
levels were underrepresented (i.e., there were few very poor families), so the range 
of between family differences was smaller than in the population as a whole. This 
means that we should be cautious in generalizing the findings for between-family 
effects across the entire social spectrum. The samples were also mostly white, but 
available data suggest that twin and sibling correlations in African-American and 
similarly selected White samples are more often comparable than not (Loehlin, Lindzey, 
&amp; Spuhler, 1975).</p>
<p>Why should individual differences in intelligence (as measured by test scores) 
reflect genetic differences more strongly in adults than they do in children's One 
possibility is that as individuals grow older their transactions with their environments 
are increasingly influenced by the characteristics that they bring to those environments 
themselves, decreasingly by the conditions imposed by family life and social origins. 
Older persons are in a better position to select their own effective environments, 
a form of genotype-environment correlation. In any case the popular view that genetic 
influences on the development of a trait are essentially frozen at conception while 
the effects of the early environment cumulate inexorably is quite misleading, at 
least for the trait of psychometric intelligence.</p>
<p><strong>Implications.</strong> Estimates of h<sup>2</sup> and c<sup>2</sup> for 
IQ (or any other trait) are descriptive statistics for the populations studied. 
(In this respect they are like means and standard deviations.) They are outcome 
measures, summarizing the results of a great many diverse, intricate, individually 
variable events and processes, but they can nevertheless be quite useful. They can 
tell us how much of the variation in a given trait the genes and family environments 
explain, and changes in them place some constraints on theories of how this occurs. 
On the other hand they have little to say about specific mechanisms, i.e. about 
how genetic and environmental differences get translated into individual physiological 
and psychological differences. Many psychologists and neuroscientists are actively 
studying such processes; data on heritabilities may give them ideas about what to 
look for and where or when to look for it.</p>
<p>A common error is to assume that because something is heritable it is necessarily 
unchangeable This is wrong. Heritability does not imply immutability. As previously 
noted, heritable traits can depend on learning, and they may be subject to other 
environmental effects as well. The value of h<sup>2</sup> can change if the distribution 
of environments (or genes) in the population is substantially altered. On the other 
hand, there can be effective environmental changes that do not change heritability 
at all. If the environment relevant to a given trait improves in a way that affects 
all members of the population equally, the mean value of the trait will rise without 
any change in its heritability (because the differences among individuals in the 
population will stay the same). This has evidently happened for height: the heritability 
of stature is high, but average heights continue to increase (Olivier, 1980). Something 
of the sort may also be taking place for IQ scores the so-called &quot;Flynn effect&quot; 
discussed in Section IV.</p>
<p>In theory, different subgroups of a population might have different distributions 
of environments or genes and hence different values of h<sup>2</sup>. This seems 
not to be the case for high and low IQ levels, for which adult heritabilities appear 
to be much the same (Saudino, Plomin, Pedersen, &amp; McClearn, 1994). It is also possible 
that an impoverished or suppressive environment could fail to support the development 
of a trait, and hence restrict individual variation. This could affect estimates 
of h<sup>2</sup>, c<sup>2</sup>, Or both, depending on the details of the process. 
Again (as in the case of whole populations), an environmental factor that affected 
every member of a subgroup equally might alter the group's mean without affecting 
heritabilities at all.</p>
<p>Where the heritability of IQ is concerned, it has sometimes seemed as if the 
findings based on differences between group means were in contradiction with those 
based on correlations. For example, children adopted in infancy into advantaged 
families tend to have higher IQs in childhood than would have been expected if they 
had been reared by their birth mothers; this is a mean difference implicating the 
environment. Yet at the same time their individual resemblance to their birth mothers 
persists, and this correlation is most plausibly interpreted in genetic terms. There 
is no real contradiction: the two findings simply call attention to different aspects 
of the same phenomenon. A sensible account must include both aspects: there is only 
a single developmental process, and it occurs in individuals. By looking at means 
or correlations one learns somewhat different but compatible things about the genetic 
and environmental contributions to that process (Turkheimer, 1991).</p>
<p>As far as behavior genetic methods are concerned, there is nothing unique about 
psychometric intelligence relative to other traits or abilities. Any reliably measured 
trait can be analyzed by these methods, and many traits including personality and 
attitudes have been. The methods are neutral with regard to genetic and environmental 
sources of variance: if individual differences on a trait are entirely due to environmental 
factors, the analysis will reveal this. These methods have shown that genes contribute 
substantially to individual differences in intelligence test performance, and that 
their role seems to increase from infancy to adulthood. They have also shown that 
variations in the unique environments of individuals are important, and that between-family 
variation contributes significantly to observed differences in IQ scores in childhood 
although this effect diminishes later on. All these conclusions are wholly consistent 
with the notion that both genes and environment, in complex interplay, are essential 
to the development of intellectual competence.</p>
<hr />
<h1>IV. ENVIRONMENTAL EFFECTS ON INTELLIGENCE</h1>
<p>The 'environment&quot; includes a wide range of influences on intelligence. Some of 
those variables affect whole populations, while others contribute to individual 
differences within a given group. Some of them are social, some are biological; 
at this point some are still mysterious. It may also happen that the proper interpretation 
of an environmental variable requires the simultaneous consideration of genetic 
effects. Nevertheless, a good deal of solid information is available.</p>
<h2>Social Variables</h2>
<p>It is obvious that the cultural environment—how people live, what they value, 
what they do—has a significant effect on the intellectual skills developed by individuals. 
Rice farmers in Liberia are good at estimating quantities of rice (Gay &amp; Cole, 1967); 
children in Botswana, accustomed to storytelling, have excellent memories for stories 
(Dube, 1982). Both these groups were far ahead of American controls on the tasks 
in question. On the other hand Americans and other Westernized groups typically 
outperform members of traditional societies on psychometric tests, even those designed 
to be &quot;culture-fair.&quot;</p>
<p>Cultures typically differ from one another in so many ways that particular differences 
can rarely be ascribed to single causes. Even comparisons between subpopulations 
are often difficult to interpret. If we find that groups living in different environments 
(e.g., middle-class and poor Americans) differ in their test scores, it is easy 
to suppose that the environmental difference causes the IQ difference. But there 
is also an opposite direction of causation: individuals may come to be in one environment 
or another because of differences in their own abilities, including the abilities 
measured by intelligence tests. Waller (1971) has shown, for example, that sons 
whose IQ scores are above those of their fathers also tend to achieve a higher social 
class status; conversely, those with scores below their fathers' tend to achieve 
lower status. Such an effect is not surprising, given the relation between IQ scores 
and years of education reviewed in Section II.</p>
<p><strong>Occupation.</strong> In section II we noted that intelligence test scores 
predict occupational level, not only because some occupations require more intelligence 
than others but also because admission to many professions depends on test scores 
in the first place. There can also be an effect in the opposite direction, i.e. 
workplaces may affect the intelligence of those who work in them. Kohn and Schooler 
(1973), who interviewed some 3000 men in various occupations (farmers, managers, 
machinists, porters...), argued that more &quot;complex&quot; jobs produce more &quot;intellectual 
flexibility&quot; in the individuals who hold them. Although the issue of direction of 
effects complicates the interpretation of their study, this remains a plausible 
suggestion.</p>
<p>Among other things, Kohn &amp; Schooler's hypothesis may help us understand urban/rural 
differences. A generation ago these were substantial in the United States, averaging 
about six IQ points or 0.4 standard deviations (Terman &amp; Merrill, 1937; Seashore, 
Wesman &amp; Doppelt, 1950). In recent years the difference has declined to about two 
points (Kaufman &amp; Doppelt, 1976; Reynolds, Chastain, Kaufman &amp; McLean, 1987). In 
all likelihood this urban/ rural convergence primarily reflects environmental changes: 
a decrease in rural isolation (due to increased travel and mass communications), 
an improvement in rural schools, the greater use of technology on farms. All these 
changes can be regarded as increasing the &quot;complexity&quot; of the rural environment 
in general or of farm work in particular. (However, processes with a genetic component, 
e.g., changes in the selectivity of migration from farm to city, cannot be completely 
excluded as contributing factors.)</p>
<p><strong>Schooling.</strong> Attendance at school is both a dependent and an independent 
variable in relation to intelligence. On the one hand, children with higher test 
scores are less likely to drop out, more likely to be promoted from grade to grade 
and then to attend college. Thus the number of years of education that adults complete 
is roughly predictable from their childhood scores on intelligence tests. On the 
other hand schooling itself changes mental abilities, including those abilities 
measured on psychometric tests. This is obvious for tests like the SAT that are 
explicitly designed to assess school learning, but it is almost equally true of 
intelligence tests themselves.</p>
<p>The evidence for the effect of schooling on intelligence test scores takes many 
forms (Ceci, 1991). When children of nearly the same age go through school a year 
apart (because of birthday-related admission criteria), those who have been in school 
longer have higher mean scores. Children who attend school intermittently score 
below those who go regularly, and test performance tends to drop over the summer 
vacation. A striking demonstration of this effect appeared when the schools in one 
Virginia county closed for several years in the 1960s to avoid integration, leaving 
most Black children with no formal education at all. Compared to controls, the intelligence-test 
scores of these children dropped by about 0.4 standard deviations (6 points) per 
missed year of school (Green et al, 1964).</p>
<p>Schools affect intelligence in several ways, most obviously by transmitting information. 
The answers to questions like &quot;Who wrote Hamlet?&quot; and &quot;What is the boiling point 
of water?&quot; are typically learned in school, where some pupils learn them more easily 
and thoroughly than others. Perhaps at least as important are certain general skills 
and attitudes: systematic problem-solving, abstract thinking, categorization, sustained 
attention to material of little intrinsic interest, repeated manipulation of basic 
symbols and operations. There is no doubt that schools promote and permit the development 
of significant intellectual skills, which develop to different extents in different 
children. It is because tests of intelligence draw on many of those same skills 
that they predict school achievement as well as they do.</p>
<p>To achieve these results, the school experience must meet at least some minimum 
standard of quality. In very poor schools, children may learn so little that they 
fall farther behind the national IQ norms for every year of attendance. When this 
happens, older siblings have systematically lower scores than their younger counterparts. 
This pattern of scores appeared in at least one rural Georgia school system in the 
1970s (Jensen, 1977). Before desegregation, it must have been characteristic of 
many of the schools attended by Black pupils in the South. In a study based on Black 
children who had moved to Philadelphia at various ages during this period, Lee (1951) 
found that their IQ scores went up more than half a point for each year that they 
were enrolled in the Philadelphia system.</p>
<p><strong>Interventions.</strong> Intelligence test scores reflect a child's standing 
relative to others in his or her age cohort. Very poor or interrupted schooling 
can lower that standing substantially; are there also ways to raise it? In fact 
many interventions have been shown to raise test scores and mental ability 'in the 
short run&quot; (i.e. while the program itself was in progress), but long-run gains have 
proved more elusive. One noteworthy example of (at least short-run) success was 
the Venezuelan Intelligence Project (Hermstein et al, 1986), in which hundreds of 
seventh-grade children from underprivileged backgrounds in that country were exposed 
to an extensive, theoretically based curriculum focused on thinking skills. The 
intervention produced substantial gains on a wide range of tests, but there has 
been no follow-up.</p>
<p>Children who participate in &quot;Head Start&quot; and similar programs are exposed to 
various school-related materials and experiences for one or two years. Their test 
scores often go up during the course of the program, but these gains fade with time. 
By the end of elementary school, there are usually no significant I9 or achievement-test 
differences between children who have been in such programs and controls who have 
not. There may, however, be other differences. Follow-up studies suggest that children 
who participated in such programs as preschoolers are less likely to be assigned 
to special education, less likely to be held back in grade, and more likely to finish 
high school than matched controls (Consortium for Longitudinal Studies, 1983; Darlington, 
1986; but see Locurto, 1991).</p>
<p>More extensive interventions might be expected to produce larger and more lasting 
effects, but few such programs have been evaluated systematically. One of the more 
successful is the Carolina Abecedarian Project (Campbell &amp; Ramey, 1994), which provided 
a group of children with enriched environments from early infancy through preschool 
and also maintained appropriate controls. The test scores of the enrichment-group 
children were already higher than those of controls at age two; they were still 
some five points higher at age twelve, seven years after the end of the intervention. 
Importantly, the enrichment group also outperformed the controls in academic achievement.</p>
<p><strong>Family environment.</strong> No one doubts that normal child development 
requires a certain minimum level of responsible care. Severely deprived, neglectful, 
or abusive environments must have negative effects on a great many aspects of development, 
including intellectual aspects. Beyond that minimum, however, the role of family 
experience is now in serious dispute (Baumrind, 1993; Jackson, 1993; Scarr, 1992, 
1993). Psychometric intelligence is a case in point. Do differences between children's 
family environments (within the normal range) produce differences in their intelligence 
test performance? The problem here is to disentangle causation from correlation. 
There is no doubt that such variables as resources of the home (Gottfried, 1984) 
and parents' use of language (Hart &amp; Risley, 1992, in press) are correlated with 
children's IQ scores, but such correlations may be mediated by genetic as well as 
(or instead of) environmental factors.</p>
<p>Behavior geneticists frame such issues in quantitative terms. As noted in Section 
3, environmental factors certainly contribute to the overall variance of psychometric 
intelligence. But how much of that variance results from differences between families, 
as contrasted with the varying experiences of different children in the same family? 
Between-family differences create what is called &quot;shared variance&quot; or c<sup>2</sup> 
(all children in a family share the same home and the same parents). Recent twin 
and adoption studies suggest that while the value of c<sup>2</sup> (for IQ scores) 
is substantial in early childhood, it becomes quite small by late adolescence.</p>
<p>These findings suggest that differences in the life styles of families whatever 
their importance may be for many aspects of children's lives make little long-term 
difference for the skills measured by intelligence tests. We should note, however, 
that low-income and non-white families are poorly represented in existing adoption 
studies as well as in most twin samples. Thus it is not yet clear whether these 
surprisingly small values of (adolescent) c<sup>2</sup> apply to the population 
as a whole. It remains possible that, across the full range of income and ethnicity, 
between-family differences have more lasting consequences for psychometric intelligence.</p>
<h2>Biological Variables</h2>
<p>Every individual has a biological as well as a social environment, one that begins 
in the womb and extends throughout life. Many aspects of that environment can affect 
intellectual development. We now know that a number of biological factors, including 
malnutrition, exposure to toxic substances, and various prenatal and perinatal stressors, 
result in lowered psychometric intelligence under at least some conditions.</p>
<p><strong>Nutrition.</strong> There has been only one major study of the effects 
of prenatal malnutrition (i.e. malnutrition of the mother during pregnancy) on long-term 
intellectual development. Stein et al (1975) analyzed the test scores of Dutch 19-year-old 
males in relation to a wartime famine that had occurred in the winter of 1944-45, 
just before their birth. In this very large sample (made possible by a universal 
military induction requirement), exposure to the famine had no effect on adult intelligence. 
Note, however, that the famine itself lasted only a few months; the subjects were 
exposed to it prenatally but not after birth.</p>
<p>In contrast, prolonged malnutrition during childhood does have long-term intellectual 
effects. These have not been easy to establish, in part because many other unfavorable 
socioeconomic conditions are often associated with chronic malnutrition (Ricciuti, 
1993; but cf. Sigman, 1995). In one intervention study, however, pre-schoolers in 
two Guatemalan villages (where undernourishment is common) were given ad lib access 
to a protein dietary supplement for several years. A decade later, many of these 
children (namely, those from the poorest socio-economic levels) scored significantly 
higher on school related achievement tests than comparable controls (Pollitt et 
al, 1993). It is worth noting that the effects of poor nutrition on intelligence 
may well be indirect. Malnourished children are typically less responsive to adults, 
less motivated to learn, and less active in exploration than their more adequately 
nourished counterparts.</p>
<p>Although the degree of malnutrition prevalent in these villages rarely occurs 
in the United States, there may still be nutritional influences on intelligence. 
In studies of so-called &quot;micro-nutrients,&quot; experimental groups of children have 
been given vitamin/mineral supplements while controls got placebos. in many of these 
studies (e.g., Schoenthaler et al, 1991), the experimental children showed test-score 
gains that significantly exceeded the controls. In a somewhat different design, 
Rush, Stein, Susser, &amp; Brody (1980) gave dietary supplements of liquid protein to 
pregnant women who were thought to be at risk for delivering low birth-weight babies. 
At one year of age, the babies born to these mothers showed faster habituation to 
visual patterns than did control infants. (Other research has shown that infant 
habituation rates are positively correlated with later psychometric test scores: 
Colombo, 1993.) Although these results are encouraging, there has been no long-term 
follow-up of such gains.</p>
<p><strong>Lead.</strong> Certain toxins have well established negative effects 
on intelligence. Exposure to lead is one such factor. In one long-term study (McMichael 
et al, 1988; Baghurst et al, 1992), the blood lead levels of children growing up 
near a lead smelting plant were substantially and negatively correlated with intelligence 
test scores throughout childhood. No &quot;threshold dose&quot; for the effect of lead appears 
in such studies. Although ambient lead levels in the United States have been reduced 
in recent years, there is reason to believe that some American children—especially 
those in inner cities—may still be at risk from this source (cf. Needleman, Geiger 
&amp; Frank, 1985).</p>
<p><strong>Alcohol</strong> Extensive prenatal exposure to alcohol (which occurs 
if the mother drinks heavily during pregnancy) can give rise to fetal alcohol syndrome, 
which includes mental retardation as well as a range of physical symptoms. Smaller 
&quot;doses&quot; of prenatal alcohol may have negative effects on intelligence even when 
the full syndrome does not appear. Streissguth et al (1989) found that mothers who 
reported consuming more than 1.5 oz, of alcohol daily during pregnancy had children 
who scored some five points below controls at age four. Prenatal exposure to aspirin 
and antibiotics had similar negative effects in this study.</p>
<p><strong>Perinatal Factors.</strong> Complications at delivery and other negative 
perinatal factors may have serious consequences for development. Nevertheless, because 
they occur only rarely, they contribute relatively little to the population variance 
of intelligence [Broman et al, 1975). Down's syndrome, a chromosomal abnormality 
that produces serious mental retardation, is also rare enough to have little impact 
on the overall distribution of test scores.</p>
<p>The correlation between birth weight and later intelligence deserves particular 
discussion. In some cases low birth weight simply reflects premature delivery; in 
others, the infant's size is below normal for its gestational age. Both factors 
apparently contribute to the tendency of low-birth-weight infants to have lower 
test scores in later childhood (Lubchenko, 1976). These correlations are small, 
ranging from .05 to .13 in different groups (Broman et al, 1975). The effects of 
low birth weight are substantial only when it is very low indeed (less than 1500 
gm). Premature babies born at these very low birth weights are behind controls on 
most developmental measures; they often have severe or permanent intellectual deficits 
(Rosetti, 1986).</p>
<h2>Continuously Rising Test Scores</h2>
<p>Perhaps the most striking of all environmental effects is the steady worldwide 
rise in intelligence test performance. Although many psychometricians had noted 
these gains, it was James Flynn (1984, 1987) who first described them systematically. 
His analysis shows that performance has been going up ever since testing began. 
The &quot;Flynn Effect&quot; is now very well documented, not only in the United States but 
in many other technologically advanced countries. The average gain is about three 
IQ points per decade; more than a full standard deviation since, say, 1940.</p>
<p>Although it is simplest to describe the gains as increases in population IQ, 
this is not exactly what happens. Most intelligence tests are &quot;re-standardized&quot; 
from time to time, in part to keep up with these very gains. As part of this process 
the mean score of the new standardization sample is typically set to 100 again, 
so the increase more or less disappears from view. In this context, the Flynn effect 
means that if twenty years have passed since the last time the test was standardized, 
people who now score 100 on the new version would probably average about 106 on 
the old one.</p>
<p>The sheer extent of these increases is remarkable, and the rate of gain may even 
be increasing. The scores of nineteen-year-olds in the Netherlands, for example, 
went up more than 8 points—over half a standard deviation-between 1972 and 1982. 
What's more, the largest gains appear on the types of tests that were specifically 
designed to be free of cultural influence (Flynn, 1987). One of these is Raven's 
Progressive Matrices, an untimed non-verbal test that many psychometricians regard 
as a good measure of g.</p>
<p>These steady gains in intelligence test performance have not always been accompanied 
by corresponding gains in school achievement. Indeed, the relation between intelligence 
and achievement test scores can be complex. This is especially true for the Scholastic 
Aptitude Test (SAT), in part because the ability range of the students who take 
the SAT has broadened over time. That change explains some portion, but not all, 
of the prolonged decline in SAT scores that took place from the mid nineteen-sixties 
to the early eighties, even as IQ scores were continuing to rise(Flynn, 1984). Meanwhile, 
however, other more representative measures show that school achievement levels 
have held steady or in some cases actually increased [Hermstein &amp; Murray, 1994). 
The National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP), for example, shows that 
the average reading and math achievement of American 13- and l7-year-olds improved 
somewhat from the early nineteen-seventies to 1990 (Grissmer, Kirby, Berends &amp; Williamson, 
1994). An analysis of these data by ethnic group, reported in Section 5, shows that 
this small overall increase actually reflects very substantial gains by Blacks and 
Latinos combined with little or no gain by Whites.</p>
<p>The consistent IQ gains documented by Flynn seem much too large to result from 
simple increases in test sophistication. Their cause is presently unknown, but three 
interpretations deserve our consideration. Perhaps the most plausible of these is 
based on the striking cultural differences between successive generations. Daily 
life and occupational experience both seem more &quot;complex&quot; (Kohn &amp; Schooler, 1973) 
today than in the time of our parents and grandparents. The population is increasingly 
urbanized; television exposes us to more information and more perspectives on more 
topics than ever before; children stay in school longer; almost everyone seems to 
be encountering new forms of experience. These changes in the complexity of life 
may have produced corresponding changes in complexity of mind, and hence in certain 
psychometric abilities.</p>
<p>A different hypothesis attributes the gains to modern improvements in nutrition. 
Lynn (1990) points out that large nutritionally-based increases in height have occurred 
during the same period as the IQ gains: perhaps there have been increases in brain 
size as well. As we have seen, however, the effects of nutrition on intelligence 
are themselves not firmly established.</p>
<p>The third interpretation addresses the very definition of intelligence. Flynn 
himself believes that real intelligence—whatever it may be—cannot have increased 
as much as these data would suggest. Consider, for example, the number of individuals 
who have IQ scores of 140 or more. (This is slightly above the cutoff used by L.M. 
Terman (1925) in his famous longitudinal study of &quot;genius.&quot;) In 1952 only 0.38% 
of Dutch test takers had IQs over 140; in 1982, scored by the same norms, 9. 12% 
exceeded this figure! Judging by these criteria, the Netherlands should now be experiencing 
&quot;...a cultural renaissance too great to be overlooked&quot; (Flynn, 1987, p.187). So 
too should France, Norway, the United States, and many other countries. Because 
Flynn (1987) finds this conclusion implausibie or absurd, he argues that what has 
risen cannot be intelligence itself but only a minor sort of &quot;abstract problem solving 
ability.&quot; The issue remains unresolved.</p>
<h2>Individual Life Experiences</h2>
<p>Although the environmental variables that produce large differences in intelligence 
are not yet well understood, genetic studies assure us that they exist. With a heritability 
well below 1.00, IQ must be subject to substantial environmental influences. Moreover, 
available heritability estimates apply only within the range of environments that 
are well-represented in the present population. We already know that some relatively 
rare conditions, like those reviewed earlier, have large negative effects on intelligence. 
Whether there are (now equally rare) conditions that have large positive effects 
is not known.</p>
<p>As we have seen, there is both a biological and a social environment. For any 
given child, the social factors include not only an overall cultural/ social/school 
setting and a particular family but also a unique &quot;micro-environment&quot; of experiences 
that are shared with no one else. The adoption studies reviewed in Section 3 show 
that family variables, such as differences in parenting style, in the resources 
of the home, etc., have smaller long-term effects than we once supposed. At least 
among people who share a given SES level and a given culture, it seems to be unique 
individual experience that makes the largest environmental contribution to adult 
IQ differences.</p>
<p>We do not yet know what the key features of those micro-environments may be. 
Are they biological? Social? Chronic? Acute? Is there something especially important 
in the earliest relations between the infant and its caretakers? Whatever the critical 
variables may be, do they interact with other aspects of family life? Of culture? 
At this point we cannot say, but these questions offer a fertile area for further 
research.</p>
<hr />
<h1>V. GROUP DIFFERENCES</h1>
<p>Group means have no direct implications for individuals. What matters for the 
next person you meet (to the extent that test scores matter at all) is that person's 
own particular score, not the mean of some reference group to which he or she happens 
to belong. The commitment to evaluate people on their own individual merit is central 
to a democratic society. It also makes quantitative sense. The distributions of 
different groups inevitably overlap, with the range of scores within any one group 
always wider than the mean differences between any two groups. In the case of intelligence 
test scores, the variance attributable to individual differences far exceeds the 
variance related to group membership (Jensen, 1980).</p>
<p>Because claims about ethnic differences have often been used to rationalize racial 
discrimination in the past, all such claims must be subjected to very careful scrutiny. 
Nevertheless, group differences continue to be the subject of intense interest and 
debate. There are many reasons for this interest: some are legal and political, 
some social and psychological. Among other things, facts about group differences 
may be relevant to the need for (and the effectiveness of) affirmative action programs. 
But while some recent discussions of intelligence and ethnic differences (e.g., 
Herrnstein &amp; Murray, 1994) have made specific policy recommendations in this area, 
we will not do so here. Such recommendations are necessarily based on political 
as well as scientific considerations, and so fall outside the scope of this report.</p>
<p>Besides European-Americans (&quot;Whites&quot;), the ethnic groups to be considered are 
Chinese- and Japanese Americans, Hispanic Americans (&quot;Latinos&quot;), Native Americans 
(&quot;Indians&quot;) and African-Americans (&quot;Blacks&quot;). These groups (we avoid the term &quot;race&quot;) 
are defined and self-defined by social conventions based on ethnic origin as well 
as on observable physical characteristics such as skin color. None of them are internally 
homogeneous. Asian Americans, for example, may have roots in many different cultures: 
not only China and Japan but Korea, Laos, Vietnam, the Philippines, India, Pakistan. 
Hispanic Americans, who share a common linguistic tradition, actually differ along 
many cultural dimensions. In their own minds they may be less &quot;Latinos&quot; than Puerto 
Ricans, Mexican-Americans Cuban Americans, or representatives of other Latin cultures. 
&quot;Native American&quot; is an even more diverse category, including a great many culturally 
distinct tribes living in a wide range of environments.</p>
<p>Although males and females are not ethnic or cultural groups, possible sex differences 
in cognitive ability have also been the subject of widespread interest and discussion. 
For this reason, the evidence relevant to such differences is briefly reviewed in 
the next section.</p>
<h2>Sex Differences</h2>
<p>Most standard tests of intelligence have been constructed so that there are no 
overall score differences between females and males. Some recent studies do report 
sex differences in IQ, but the direction is variable and the effects are small (Held, 
Alderton, Foley, &amp; Segall, 1993; Lynn, 1994). This overall equivalence does not 
imply equal performance on every individual ability. While some tasks show no sex 
differences, there are others where small differences appear and a few where they 
are large and consistent.</p>
<p><strong>Spatial and quantitative Abilities.</strong> Large differences favoring 
males appear on visual-spatial tasks like mental rotation and spatio-temporal tasks 
like tracking a moving object through space (Law, Pellegrino, &amp; Hunt, 1993; Linn 
&amp; Petersen, 1985). The sex difference on mental rotation tasks is substantial: a 
recent meta-analysis (Masters &amp; Sanders, 1993) puts the effect size at d = 0.9. 
(Effect sizes are measured in standard deviation units. Here, the mean of the male 
distribution is nearly one standard deviation above that for females.) Males' achievement 
levels on movement-related and visual-spatial tests are relevant to their generally 
better performance in tasks that involve aiming and throwing (Jardine &amp; Martin, 
1983).</p>
<p>Some quantitative abilities also show consistent differences. Females have a 
clear advantage on quantitative tasks in the early years of school (Hyde, Fennema, 
&amp; Lamon, 1990), but this reverses sometime before puberty; males then maintain their 
superior performance into old age. The math portion of the Scholastic Aptitude Test 
shows a substantial advantage for males (d = 0.33 to 0.50), with many more males 
scoring in the highest ranges (Benbow, 1988; Halpern, 1992). Males also score consistently 
higher on tests of proportional and mechanical reasoning [Meehan, 1984; Stanley, 
Benbow, Brody, Dauber, &amp; Lupkowski, 1992).</p>
<p><strong>Verbal Abilities.</strong> Some verbal tasks show substantial mean differences 
favoring females. These include synonym generation and verbal fluency (e.g., naming 
words that start with a given letter), with effect sizes ranging from d = 0.5 to 
1.2 (Gordon &amp; Lee, 1986; Hines, 1990). On average females score higher on college 
achievement tests in literature, English composition, and Spanish (Stanley, 1993) 
they also excel at reading and spelling Many more males than females are diagnosed 
with dyslexia and other reading disabilities (Sutaria, 1985), and there are many 
more male stutterers (Yairi &amp; Ambrose, 1992). Some memory tasks also show better 
performance by females, but the size (and perhaps even the direction) of the effect 
varies with the type of memory being assessed.</p>
<p><strong>Causal Factors.</strong> There are both social and biological reasons 
for these differences. At the social level there are both subtle and overt differences 
between the experiences, expectations, and gender roles of females and males. Relevant 
environmental differences appear soon after birth. They range from the gender-differentiated 
toys that children regularly receive to the expectations of adult life with which 
they are presented, from gender-differentiated household and leisure activities 
to assumptions about differences in basic ability. Models that include many of these 
psychosocial variables have been successful in predicting academic achievement (Eccles, 
1987).</p>
<p>Many biological variables are also relevant. One focus of current research is 
on differences in the sizes or shapes of particular neural structures. Numerous 
sexually dimorphic brain structures have now been identified, and they may well 
have implications for cognition. There are, for example, sex related differences 
in the sizes of some portions of the corpus callosum; these differences are correlated 
with verbal fluency (Hines, Chiu, McAdams, Bentler, &amp; Lipcamon, 1992). Recent brain 
imaging studies have found what may be differences in the lateralization of language 
(Shaywitz et al., 1995). Note that such differences in neural structure could result 
from differences in patterns of life experience as well as from genetically-driven 
mechanisms of brain development; moreover, brain development and experience may 
have bi-directional effects on each other. This research area is still in a largely 
exploratory phase.</p>
<p><strong>Hormonal Influences.</strong> The importance of prenatal exposure to 
sex hormones is well established. Hormones influence not only the developing genitalia 
but also the brain and certain immune system structures (Geschwind &amp; Gaiaburda, 
1987; Halpern &amp; Cass, 1994). Several studies have tested individuals who were exposed 
to abnormally high androgen levels in utero, due to a condition known as congenital 
adrenal hyperplasia(CAH). Adult CAH females score significantly higher than controls 
on tests of spatial ability (Resnick, Berenbaum, Gottesman &amp; Bouchard, 1986); CAH 
girls play more with &quot;boys' toys&quot; and less with 'girls' toys&quot; than controls (Berenbaum 
&amp; Hines, 1992).</p>
<p>Other experimental paradigms confirm the relevance of sex hormones for performance 
levels in certain skills. Christiansen and Knussman (1987) found testosterone levels 
in normal males to be correlated positively (about .20) with some measures of spatial 
ability and negatively (about -.20) with some measures of verbal ability. Older 
males given testosterone show improved performance on visual-spatial tests (Janowsky, 
Oviatt, &amp; Orwoll, 1994). Many similar findings have been reported, though the effects 
are often non-linear and complex (Gouchie &amp; Kimura, 1991; Nyborg, 1984). It is clear 
that any adequate model of sex differences in cognition will have to take both biological 
and psychological variables (and their interactions) into account.</p>
<h2>Mean Scores of Different Ethnic Groups</h2>
<p><strong>Asian Americans.</strong> In the years since the Second World War, Asian 
Americans, especially those of Chinese and Japanese extraction, have compiled an 
outstanding record of academic and professional achievement. This record is reflected 
in school grades, in scores on content-oriented achievement tests like the SAT and 
GRE, and especially in the disproportionate representation of Asian Americans in 
many sciences and professions. Although it is often supposed that these achievements 
reflect correspondingly high intelligence test scores, this is not the case. In 
more than a dozen studies from the 1960s and 1970s analyzed by Flynn (1991), the 
mean IQs of Japanese- and Chinese American children were always around 97 or 98; 
none was over 100. Even Lynn (1993), who argues for a slightly higher figure concedes 
that the achievements of these Asian Americans far outstrip what might have been 
expected on the basis of their test scores.</p>
<p>It may be worth noting that the interpretation of test scores obtained by Asians 
in Asia has been controversial in its own right. Lynn (1982) reported a mean Japanese 
IQ of 111, Flynn (1991) estimated it to be between 101 and 105; Stevenson et al 
(1985), comparing the intelligence-test performance of children in Japan, Taiwan 
and the United States, found no substantive differences at all. Given the general 
problems of cross-cultural comparison, there is no reason to expect precision or 
stability in such estimates. Nevertheless some interest attaches to these particular 
comparisons: they show that the well-established differences in school achievement 
among the same three groups (Chinese and Japanese children are much better at math 
than American children) do not simply reflect differences in psychometric intelligence. 
Stevenson et a1(1986) suggest that they result from structural differences in the 
schools of the three nations as well as from varying cultural attitudes toward learning 
itself. It is also possible that spatial ability, in which Japanese and Chinese 
obtain somewhat higher scores than Americans, plays a particular role in the learning 
of mathematics.</p>
<p>One interesting way to assess the achievements of Chinese- and Japanese-Americans 
is to reverse the usual direction of prediction. Data from the 1980 census shows 
that the proportion of Chinese Americans employed in managerial, professional, or 
technical occupations was 55% and that of Japanese was 46%. (For whites, the corresponding 
figure was 34%.) Using the well-established correlation between intelligence test 
scores and occupational level, Flynn (1991, p.99) calculated the mean IQ that a 
hypothetical White group &quot;would have to have&quot; to predict the same proportions of 
upper-level employment. He found that the occupational success of these Chinese 
Americans, whose mean IQ was in fact slightly below 100, was what would be expected 
of a White group with an IQ of almost 120! A similar calculation for Japanese-Americans 
shows that their level of achievement matched that of Whites averaging 110. These 
&quot;over-achievements&quot; serve as sharp reminders of the limitations of IQ-based prediction. 
Various aspects of Chinese-American and Japanese American culture surely contribute 
to them (Schneider, Hieshima, Lee &amp; Plank, 1994); gene-based temperamental factors 
could conceivably be playing a role as well (Freedman &amp; Freedman, 1969).</p>
<p><strong>Hispanic Americans.</strong> Hispanic immigrants have come to America 
from many countries. In 1993, the largest Latino groups in the continental United 
States were Mexican Americans (64%), Puerto Ricans (11%), Central and South Americans 
(13%), and Cubans (5%) (U.S. Bureau of the Census, 1994). There are very substantial 
cultural differences among these nationality groups, as well as differences in academic 
achievement (Duran, 1983; USNCEP, 1982). Taken together, Latinos make up the second 
largest and the fastest-growing minority group in America (Davis, Haub &amp; Willette, 
1983; Eyde, 1992).</p>
<p>The mean intelligence test scores of Hispanics typically lie between those of 
Blacks and Whites. There are also differences in the patterning of scores across 
different abilities and subtests (Hennessy &amp; Merrifield, 1978; Lesser, Fifer &amp; Clark, 
1965). Linguistic factors play a particularly important role for Hispanic Americans, 
who may know relatively little English. (By one estimate, 25% of Puerto Ricans and 
Mexican Americans and at least 40% of Cubans speak English 'not well&quot; or 'not at 
all&quot;—Rodriguez, 1992). Even those who describe themselves as bilingual may be at 
a disadvantage if Spanish was their first and best-learned language. It is not surprising 
that Latino children typically score higher on the performance than on the verbal 
subtests of the English-based WISC-R (Kaufman, 1994). Nevertheless, the predictive 
validity of Latino test scores is not negligible. In young children, the WISC-R 
has reasonably high correlations with school achievement measures (McShane &amp; Cook, 
1985). For high school students of moderate to high English proficiency, standard 
aptitude tests predict first-year college grades about as well as they do for non 
Hispanic Whites (Pennock-Roman, 1992).</p>
<p><strong>Native Americans.</strong> There are a great many culturally distinct 
North American Indian tribes (Driver, 1969), speaking some 200 different languages 
(Leap, 1981). Many Native Americans live on reservations, which themselves represent 
a great variety of ecological and cultural settings. Many others presently live 
in metropolitan areas (Brandt, 1984). Although few generalizations can be appropriate 
across so wide a range, two or three points seem fairly well established. The first 
is a specific relation between ecology and cognition: the Inuit (Eskimo) and other 
groups that live in the arctic tend to have particularly high visual-spatial skills. 
(For a review see McShane &amp; Berry, 1988.) Moreover, there seem to be no substantial 
sex differences in those skills (Berry, 1974). It seems likely that this represents 
an adaptation—genetic or learned or both—to the difficult hunting, traveling and 
living conditions that characterize the arctic environment.</p>
<p>On the average Indian children obtain relatively low scores on tests of verbal 
intelligence, which are often administered in school settings. The result is a performance-test/verbal-test 
discrepancy similar to that exhibited by Hispanic Americans and other groups whose 
first language is generally not English. Moreover, many Indian children suffer from 
chronic middle-ear infection (otitis media), which is &quot;the leading identifiable 
disease among Indians since record-keeping began in 1962&quot; (McShane &amp; Plas, 1984b, 
p.84). Hearing loss can have marked negative effects on verbal test performance 
(McShane &amp; Plas, 1984a).</p>
<p><strong>African Americans.</strong> The relatively low mean of the distribution 
of African-American intelligence test scores has been discussed for many years. 
Although studies using different tests and samples yield a range of results, the 
Black mean is typically about one standard deviation (about 15 points) below that 
of Whites (Loehlin et al, 1975; Jensen, 1980; Reynolds et al, 1987). The difference 
is largest on those tests (verbal or non-verbal) that best represent the general 
intelligence factor g (Jensen, 1985). It is possible, however, that this differential 
is diminishing. In the most recent re-standardization of the Stanford-Binet test, 
the Black/White differential was 13 points for younger children and 10 points for 
older children (Thorndike et al, 1986). In several other studies of children since 
1980, the Black mean has consistently been over 90 and the differential has been 
in single digits (Vincent, 1991). Larger and more definitive studies are needed 
before this trend can be regarded as established.</p>
<p>Another reason to think the IQ mean might be changing is that the Black/ White 
differential in achievement scores has diminished substantially in the last few 
years. Consider, for example, the mathematics achievement of five year olds as measured 
by the National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP). The differential between 
Black and White scores, about 1.1 standard deviations as recently as 1978, had shrunk 
to .65 SD by 1990 (Grissmer et al, 1994) because of Black gains. Hispanics showed 
similar but smaller gains; there was little change in the scores of Whites. Other 
assessments of school achievement also show substantial recent gains in the performance 
of minority children.</p>
<p>In their own analysis of these gains, Grissmer et al (1994) cite both demographic 
factors and the effects of public policy. They found the level of parents' education 
to be a particularly good predictor of children's' school achievement; that level 
increased for all groups between 1970 and 1990, but most sharply for Blacks. Family 
size was another good predictor (children from smaller families tend to achieve 
higher scores); here too, the largest change over time was among Blacks. Above and 
beyond these demographic effects, Grissmer et al believe that some of the gains 
can be attributed to the many specific programs, geared to the education of minority 
children, that were implemented during that period.</p>
<p><strong>Test Bias.</strong> It is often argued that the lower mean scores of 
African Americans reflect a bias in the intelligence tests themselves. This argument 
is right in one sense of &quot;bias&quot; but wrong in another. To see the first of these, 
consider how the term is used in probability theory. When a coin comes up heads 
consistently for any reason it is said to be 'biased,&quot; regardless of any consequences 
that the outcome may or may&quot;not have. In this sense the Black/White score differential 
is ipso facto evidence of what may be called &quot;outcome bias.&quot; African Americans are 
subject to outcome bias not only with respect to tests but along many dimensions 
of American life. They have the short end of nearly every stick: average income, 
representation in high-level occupations, health and health care, death rate, confrontations 
with the legal system, and so on. With this situation in mind, some critics regard 
the test score differential as just another example of a pervasive outcome bias 
that characterizes our society as a whole (Jackson, 1975; Mercer, 1984). Although 
there is a sense in which they are right, this critique ignores the particular social 
purpose that tests are designed to serve.</p>
<p>From an educational point of view, the chief function of mental tests is as predictors 
(Section 2). Intelligence tests predict school performance fairly well, at least 
in American schools as they are now constituted. Similarly, achievement tests are 
fairly good predictors of performance in college and postgraduate settings. Considered 
in this light, the relevant question is whether the tests have a &quot;predictive bias&quot; 
against Blacks, Such a bias would exist if African-American performance on the criterion 
variables (school achievement, college GPA, etc.) were systematically higher than 
the same subjects' test scores would predict. This is not the case. The actual regression 
lines (which show the mean criterion performance for individuals who got various 
scores on the predictor) for Blacks do not lie above those for Whites; there is 
even a slight tendency in the other direction (Jensen, 1980; Reynolds &amp;:Brown, 1984). 
Considered as predictors of future performance, the tests do not seem to be biased 
against African Americans.</p>
<p><strong>Characteristics of Tests.</strong> It has been suggested that various 
aspects of the way tests are formulated and administered may put African Americans 
at an disadvantage. The language of testing is a standard form of English with which 
some Blacks may not be familiar; specific vocabulary items are often unfamiliar 
to Black children; the tests are often given by White examiners rather than by more 
familiar Black teachers; African Americans may not be motivated to work hard on 
tests that so clearly reflect White values; the time demands of some tests may be 
alien to Black culture. (Similar suggestions have been made in connection with the 
test performance of Hispanic Americans, e.g., Rodriguez, 1992.) Many of these suggestions 
are plausible, and such mechanisms may play a role in particular cases. Controlled 
studies have shown, however, that none of them contributes substantially to the 
Black/White differential under discussion here (Jensen, 1980; Reynolds 82 Brown, 
1984; for a different view see Helms, 1992). Moreover, efforts to devise reliable 
and valid tests that would minimize disadvantages of this kind have been unsuccessful.</p>
<h2>Interpreting Group Differences</h2>
<p>If group differences in test performance do not result from the simple forms 
of bias reviewed above, what is responsible for them? The fact is that we do not 
know. Various explanations have been proposed, but none is generally accepted. It 
is clear, however, that these differences, whatever their origin, are well within 
the range of effect sizes that can be produced by environmental factors. The Black/White 
differential amounts to one standard deviation or less, and we know that environmental 
factors have recently raised mean test scores in many populations by at least that 
much (Flynn, 1987: see Section 4). To be sure, the &quot;Flynn effect&quot; is itself poorly 
understood: it may reflect generational changes in culture, improved nutrition, 
or other factors as yet unknown. Whatever may be responsible for it, we cannot exclude 
the possibility that the same factors play a role in contemporary group differences.</p>
<p><strong>Socio-economic Factors</strong>. Several specific environmental/cultural 
explanations of those differences have been proposed. All of them refer to the general 
life situation in which contemporary African Americans find themselves, but that 
situation can be described in several different ways. The simplest such hypothesis 
can be framed in economic terms. On the average, Blacks have lower incomes than 
Whites; a much higher proportion of them are poor. It is plausible to suppose that 
many inevitable aspects of poverty, such as poor nutrition, frequently inadequate 
prenatal care, and lack of intellectual resources, have negative effects on children's 
developing intelligence. Indeed, the correlation between &quot;socio-economic status&quot; 
(SES) and scores on intelligence tests is well known (White, 1982).</p>
<p>Several considerations suggest that this cannot be the whole explanation. For 
one thing, the Black/White differential in test scores is not eliminated when groups 
or individuals are matched for SES (Loehlin et al, 1975). Moreover, the data reviewed 
in Section 4 suggest that excluding extreme conditions, nutrition and other biological 
factors that may vary with SES account for relatively little of the variance in 
such scores. Finally the (relatively weak) relationship between test scores and 
income is much more complex than a simple SES hypothesis would suggest. The living 
conditions of children result in part from the accomplishments of their parents: 
if the skills measured by psychometric tests actually matter for those accomplishments. 
intelligence is affecting SES rather than the other way around. We do not know the 
magnitude of these various effects in various populations, but it is clear that 
no model in which 'SES&quot; directly determines &quot;IQ&quot; will do.</p>
<p>A more fundamental difficulty with explanations based on economics alone appears 
from a different perspective. To imagine that any simple income- and education-based 
index can adequately describe the situation of African Americans is to ignore important 
categories of experience. The sense of belonging to a group with a distinctive culture, 
one that has long been the target of oppression, and the awareness or anticipation 
of racial discrimination are profound personal experiences, not just aspects of 
socio-economic status. Some of these more deeply rooted differences are addressed 
by other hypotheses, based on caste and culture.</p>
<p><strong>Caste-like Minorities.</strong> Most discussions of this issue treat 
Black/ White differences as aspects of a uniquely &quot;American Dilemma&quot; (Myriad, 1944). 
The fact is, however, that comparably disadvantaged groups exist in many countries: 
the Maori in New Zealand, scheduled castes (&quot;untouchables&quot;) in India, non-European 
Jews in Israel, the Burakumin in Japan. All these are &quot;caste-like&quot; (Ogbu, 1978) 
or &quot;involuntary&quot; (Ogbu, 1994) minorities. John Ogbu distinguishes this status from 
that of &quot;autonomous&quot; minorities who are not politically or economically subordinated 
(like Amish or Mormons in the U.S.), and from that of &quot;immigrant&quot; or &quot;voluntary&quot; 
minorities who initially came to their new homes with positive expectations. Immigrant 
minorities expect their situations to improve; they tend to compare themselves favorably 
with peers in the old country, not unfavorably with members of the dominant majority. 
In contrast, to be born into a caste-like minority is to grow up firmly convinced 
that one's life will eventually be restricted to a small and poorly-rewarded set 
of social roles.</p>
<p>Distinctions of caste are not always linked to perceptions of race. In some countries 
lower and upper caste groups differ by appearance and are assumed to be racially 
distinct; in others they are not. The social and educational consequences are the 
same in both cases. All over the world, the children of castelike minorities do 
less well in school than upper-caste children and drop out sooner. Where there are 
data, they have usuallv been found to have lower test scores as well.</p>
<p>In explaining these findings, Ogbu (1978) argues that the children of caste-like 
minorities do not have &quot;effort optimism,&quot; i.e., the conviction that hard work (especially 
hard schoolwork) and serious commitment on their part will actually be rewarded. 
As a result they ignore or reject the forms of learning that are offered in school. 
Indeed they may practice a sort of cultural inversion, deliberately rejecting certain 
behaviors (such as academic achievement or other forms of &quot;acting white&quot;) that are 
seen as characteristic of the dominant group. While the extent to which the attitudes 
described by Ogbu (1978, 1994) are responsible for African-American test scores 
and school achievement has not been empirically established, it does seem that familiar 
problems can take on quite a different look when they are viewed from an international 
perspective.</p>
<p><strong>African-American Culture.</strong> According to Boykin (1986, 1994), 
there is a fundamental conflict between certain aspects of African-American culture 
on the one hand and the implicit cultural commitments of most American schools on 
the other. &quot;When children are ordered to do their own work, arrive at their own 
individual answers, work only with their own materials, they are being sent cultural 
messages. When children come to believe that getting up and moving about the classroom 
is inappropriate, they are being sent powerful cultural messages. When children 
come to confine their 'learning' to consistently bracketed time periods, when they 
are consistently prompted to tell what they know and not how they feel, when they 
are led to believe that they are completely responsible for their own success and 
failure, when they are required to consistently put forth considerable effort for 
effort's sake on tedious and personally irrelevant tasks ... then they are pervasively 
having cultural lessons imposed on them&quot; (1994, pp. 180-181).</p>
<p>In Boykin's view, the combination of constriction and competition that most American 
schools demand of their pupils conflicts with certain themes in the &quot;deep structure&quot; 
of African-American culture. That culture includes an emphasis on such aspects of 
experience as spirituality, harmony, movement, verve, affect, expressive individualism, 
communalism, orality, and a socially defined time perspective (Boykin, 1986, 1994). 
While it is not shared by all African Americans to the same degree, its accessibility 
and familiarity give it a profound influence.</p>
<p>The result of this cultural conflict, in Boykin's view, is that many Black children 
become alienated from both the process and the products of the education to which 
they are exposed. One aspect of that process, now an intrinsic aspect of the culture 
of most American schools, is the psychometric enterprise itself. He argues (Boykin, 
1994) that the successful education of African-American children will require an 
approach that is less concerned with talent sorting and assessment, more concerned 
with talent development.</p>
<p>One further factor should not be overlooked. Only a single generation has passed 
since the Civil Rights movement opened new doors for African Americans, and many 
forms of discrimination are still all too familiar in their experience today. Hard 
enough to bear in its own right, discrimination is also a sharp reminder of a still 
more intolerable past. It would be rash indeed to assume that those experiences, 
and that historical legacy, have no impact on intellectual development.</p>
<p><strong>The Genetic Hypothesis.</strong> It is sometimes suggested that the Black/ 
White differential in psychometric intelligence is partly due to genetic differences 
(Jensen, 1972). There is not much direct evidence on this point, but what little 
there is fails to support the genetic hypothesis. Once piece of evidence comes from 
a study of the children of American soldiers stationed in Germany after the Second 
World War (Eyferth, 1961): there was no mean difference between the test scores 
of those children whose fathers were White and those whose fathers were Black. (For 
a discussion of possible confounds in this study, see Flynn, 1980.) Moreover, several 
studies have used blood-group methods to estimate the degree of African ancestry 
of American Blacks; there were no significant correlations between those estimates 
and IQ scores (Loehlin et al, 1973; Scarr et al, 1977).</p>
<p>It is clear (Section III) that genes make a substantial contribution to individual 
differences in intelligence test scores, at least in the white population. The fact 
is, however, that the high heritability of a trait within a given group has no necessary 
implications for the source of a difference between groups (Loehlin et al, 1975). 
This is now generally understood (e.g., Herrnstein &amp; Murray, 1994). But even though 
no such implication is necessary, some have argued that a high value of h2 makes 
a genetic hypothesis more plausible. Does it?</p>
<p>That depends on one's assessment of the actual difference between the two environments. 
Consider Lewontin's (1970) well-known example of seeds from the same genetically 
variable stock that are planted in two different fields. If the plants in field 
X are fertilized appropriately while key nutrients are withheld from those in field 
Y, we have produced an entirely environmental group difference. This example works 
(i.e., h2 is genuinely irrelevant to the differential between the fields) because 
the differences between the effective environments of X and Y are both large and 
consistent. Are the environmental and cultural situations of American Blacks and 
Whites also substantially and consistently different—different enough to make this 
a good analogy? If so, the within-group heritability of IQ scores is irrelevant 
to the issue. Or are those situations similar enough to suggest that the analogy 
is inappropriate, and that one can plausibly generalize from within-group heritabilities? 
Thus the issue ultimately comes down to a personal judgment: how different are the 
relevant life experiences of Whites and Blacks in the United States today? At present, 
this question has no scientific answer.</p>
<hr />
<h1>VI. SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS</h1>
<p>Because there are many ways to be intelligent, there are also many conceptualizations 
of intelligence. The most influential approach, and the one that has generated the 
most systematic research, is based on psychometric testing. This tradition has produced 
a substantial body of knowledge, though many questions remain unanswered. We know 
much less about the forms of intelligence that tests do not easily assess: wisdom, 
creativity, practical knowledge, social skill, and the like.</p>
<p>Psychometricians have successfully measured a wide range of abilities, distinct 
from one another and yet intercorrelated. The complex relations among those abilities 
can be described in many ways. Some theorists focus on the variance that all such 
abilities have in common, which Spearman termed g (&quot;general intelligence&quot;); others 
prefer to describe the same manifold with a set of partially independent factors; 
still others opt for a muitifactorial description with factors hierarchically arranged 
and something like g at the top. Standardized intelligence test scores (&quot;IQs&quot;), 
which reflect a person's standing in relation to his or her age cohort, are based 
on tests that tap a number of different abilities. Recent studies have found that 
these scores are also correlated with information processing speed in certain experimental 
paradigms (choice reaction time, inspection time, evoked brain potentials, etc.), 
but the meaning of those correlations is far from clear.</p>
<p>Intelligence test scores predict individual differences in school achievement 
moderately well, correlating about .50 with grade point average and .55 with the 
number of years of education that individuals complete. In this context the skills 
measured by tests are clearly important. Nevertheless, population levels of school 
achievement are not determined solely or even primarily by intelligence or any other 
individual difference variable. The fact that children in Japan and Taiwan learn 
much more math than their peers in America, for example, can be attributed primarily 
to differences in culture and schooling rather than in abilities measured by intelligence 
tests.</p>
<p>Test scores also correlate with measures of accomplishment outside of school, 
e.g. with adult occupational status. To some extent those correlations result directly 
from the tests' link with school achievement and from their roles as &quot;gatekeepers.&quot; 
In the United States today, high test scores and grades are prerequisites for entry 
into many careers and professions. This is not quite the whole story, however: a 
significant correlation between psychometric intelligence and occupational status 
remains even when measures of education and family background have been statistically 
controlled. There are also modest (negative) correlations between intelligence test 
scores and certain undesirable behaviors such as juvenile crime. Those correlations 
are necessarily low: all social outcomes result from complex causal webs in which 
psychometric skills are only one factor.</p>
<p>Like every trait, intelligence is the joint product of genetic and environmental 
variables. Gene action always involves a (biochemical or social) environment; environments 
always act via structures to which genes have contributed. Given a trait on which 
individuals vary, however, one can ask what fraction of that variation is associated 
with differences in their genotypes (this is the heritability of the trait) as well 
as what fraction is associated with differences in environmental experience. So 
defined, heritability (h<sup>2</sup>) can and does vary from one population to another. 
In the case of IQ, h<sup>2</sup> is markedly lower for children (about .45) than 
for adults (about .75). This means that as children grow up, differences in test 
scores tend increasingly to reflect differences in genotype and in individual life 
experience rather than differences among the families in which they were raised.</p>
<p>The factors underlying that shift—and more generally the pathways by which genes 
make their undoubted contributions to individual differences in intelligence—are 
largely unknown. Moreover, the environmental contributions to those differences 
are almost equally mysterious. We know that both biological and social aspects of 
the environment are important for intelligence, but we are a long way from understanding 
how they exert their effects.</p>
<p>One environmental variable with clear-cut importance is the presence of formal 
schooling. Schools affect intelligence in many ways, not only by transmitting specific 
information but by developing certain intellectual skills and attitudes. Failure 
to attend school (Or attendance at very poor schools) has a clear negative effect 
on intelligence test scores. Pre-school programs and similar interventions often 
have positive effects, but in most cases the gains fade when the program is over.</p>
<p>A number of conditions in the biological environment have clear negative consequences 
for intellectual development. Some of these conditions, which are very important 
when they occur, nevertheless do not contribute much to the population variance 
of IQ scores because they are relatively rare. (Perinatal complications are one 
such factor.) Exposure to environmental lead has well-documented negative effects; 
so too does prenatal exposure to high blood levels of alcohol. Malnutrition in childhood 
is another negative factor for intelligence, but the level at which its effects 
become significant has not been clearly established. Some studies suggest that dietary 
supplements of certain micro-nutrients can produce gains even in otherwise well-nourished 
individuals, but the effects are still controversial and there has been no long-term 
follow-up.</p>
<p>One of the most striking phenomena in this field is the steady world-wide rise 
in test scores, now often called the &quot;Flynn effect.&quot; Mean IQs have increased more 
than 15 points—a full standard deviation—in the last fifty years, and the rate of 
gain may be increasing. These gains may result from improved nutrition, cultural 
changes, experience with testing, shifts in schooling or child-rearing practices, 
or some other factor as yet unknown,</p>
<p>Although there are no important sex differences in overall intelligence test 
scores, substantial differences do appear for specific abilities. Males typically 
score higher on visual-spatial and (beginning in middle childhood) mathematical 
skills; females excel on a number of verbal measures. Sex hormone levels are clearly 
related to some of these differences, but social factors presumably play a role 
as well. As for all the group differences reviewed here, the range of performance 
within each group is much larger than the mean difference between groups.</p>
<p>Because ethnic differences in intelligence reflect complex patterns, no overall 
generalization about them is appropriate. The mean IQ scores of Chinese- and Japanese-Americans, 
for example, differ little from those of Whites though their spatial ability scores 
tend to be somewhat higher. The outstanding record of these groups in terms of school 
achievement and occupational status evidently reflects cultural factors. The mean 
intelligence test scores of Hispanic Americans are somewhat lower than those of 
Whites, in part because Hispanics are often less familiar with English. Nevertheless 
their test scores, like those of African Americans, are reasonably good predictors 
of school and college achievement.</p>
<p>African-American IQ scores have long averaged about 15 points below those of 
Whites, with correspondingly lower scores on academic achievement tests. In recent 
years the achievement-test gap has narrowed appreciably. It is possible that the 
IQ-score differential is narrowing as well, but this has not been clearly established. 
The cause of that differential is not known; it is apparently not due to any simple 
form of bias in the content or administration of the tests themselves. The Flynn 
effect shows that environmental factors can produce differences of at least this 
magnitude, but that effect is mysterious in its own right. Several culturally based 
explanations of the Black/ White IQ differential have been proposed; some are plausible, 
but so far none has been conclusively supported. There is even less empirical support 
for a genetic interpretation. In short, no adequate explanation of the differential 
between the IQ means of Blacks and Whites is presently available.</p>
<p>It is customary to conclude surveys like this one with a summary of what has 
been established. Indeed, much is now known about intelligence. A near century of 
research, most of it based on psychometric methods, has produced an impressive body 
of findings. Although we have tried to do justice to those findings in this report, 
it seems appropriate to conclude on a different note. In this contentious arena, 
our most useful role may be to remind our readers that many of the critical questions 
about intelligence are still unanswered. Here are a few of those questions: </p>
<ol>
	<li>Differences in genetic endowment contribute substantially to individual 
	differences in (psychometric) intelligence, but the pathway by which genes produce 
	their effects is still unknown. The impact of genetic differences appears to 
	increase with age, but we do not know why.<br />
	</li>
	<li>Environmental factors also contribute substantially to the development of 
	intelligence, but we do not clearly understand what those factors are or how 
	they work. Attendance at school is certainly important, for example, but we 
	do not know what aspects of schooling are critical.<br />
	</li>
	<li>The role of nutrition in intelligence remains obscure. Severe childhood 
	malnutrition has clear negative effects, but the hypothesis that particular 
	&quot;micro-nutrients&quot; may affect intelligence in otherwise adequately-fed populations 
	has not yet been convincingly demonstrated.<br />
	</li>
	<li>There are significant correlations between measures of information processing 
	speed and psychometric intelligence, but the overall pattern of these findings 
	yields no easy theoretical interpretation.<br />
	</li>
	<li>Mean scores on intelligence tests are rising steadily. They have gone up 
	a full standard deviation in the last fifty years or so, and the rate of gain 
	may be increasing. No one is sure why these gains are happening or what they 
	mean.<br />
	</li>
	<li>The differential between the mean intelligence test scores of Blacks and 
	Whites (about one standard deviation, although it may be diminishing) does not 
	result from any obvious biases in test construction and administration, nor 
	does it simply reflect differences in socio-economic status. Explanations based 
	on factors of caste and culture may be appropriate, but so far have little direct 
	empirical support. There is certainly no such support for a genetic interpretation. 
	At present, no one knows what causes this differential.<br />
	</li>
	<li>It is widely agreed that standardized tests do not sample all forms of intelligence. 
	Obvious examples include creativity, wisdom, practical sense and social sensitivity; 
	there are surely others. Despite the importance of these abilities we know very 
	little about them: how they develop, what factors influence that development, 
	how they are related to more traditional measures.<br />
	</li>
</ol>
<p>In a field where so many issues are unresolved and so many questions unanswered, 
the confident tone that has characterized most of the debate on these topics is 
clearly out of place. The study of intelligence does not need politicized assertions 
and recriminations; it needs self-restraint, reflection, and a great deal more research. 
The questions that remain are socially as well as scientifically important. There 
is no reason to think them unanswerable, but finding the answers will require a 
shared and sustained effort as well as the commitment of substantial scientific 
resources. Just such a commitment is what we strongly recommend.</p>
