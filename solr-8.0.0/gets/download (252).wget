			<p><a href="https://go.sinequa.com/IDC-finance-spotlight.html" ><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1351" alt="ScreenHunter_1549 Jan. 16 16.48" src="https://blog.sinequa.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/ScreenHunter_1549-Jan.-16-16.48.jpg" width="924" height="493" /></a>With increased regulatory pressures, data silo proliferation and cognitive drain on analysts, AI-powered platforms become a key enabler to extract insights from data.</p>
<p>Today, we announced that Sinequa is featured in a new IDC Technology Spotlight report: <a href="https://go.sinequa.com/IDC-finance-spotlight.html" >Financial Services Organizations: Extracting Powerful Insights with AI-Powered Platforms</a>. The report, written by Steven D&#8217;Alfonso, research director, IDC Financial Insights, and David Schubmehl, research director, Cognitive/AI Systems, highlights the importance of AI-powered platforms in their ability to extract insights from data as well as the need for financial services organizations (FSOs) to improve their capabilities to derive insights from the data they possess.</p>
<p>According to the report, collecting and maintaining increased amounts of data related to their clients and portfolios can provide major opportunities to improve the customer experience and increase revenue while reducing risk. But at the same time, too much data can be a cognitive drain on analysts and knowledge workers. This increasing need to collect data from multiple applications requires FSO stakeholders to organize and provision their data in ways that allow analysts to extract meaningful insights. AI can help FSOs mature from being data-driven to being information-driven.</p>
<p>“Over the years, Sinequa has continued to expand its footprint within leading financial institutions such as Credit Agricole, DZ Bank, LCL, Navy Federal Credit Union, and U.S. Bank as our platform enables them to tackle the challenges highlighted in this report,” said Scott Parker, director of product marketing at Sinequa. “By offering a broad-based AI-powered platform including search, content analytics, semantic understanding and auto categorization technologies, Sinequa provides relevant insights to users in their work environments, while supporting a range of machine learning algorithms and capabilities to improve findability and relevance, allowing FSOs to access the information they need when they need it.”</p>
<p>With the demand for AI technologies that enable intelligent analytics increasing every year, IDC estimates that “by 2022 spending on AI technologies will grow to over $8 billion, up from $2 billion in 2017.” Sinequa has in the past offered a flexible information collection, access and analysis architecture and now provides cognitive capabilities, such as machine learning, natural language processing, improved relevance and better decision support, while offering intuitive user and data interaction capabilities.</p>

				<div class="entry-content">
			<p><a href="https://blog.sinequa.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/2018.jpeg" ><img class="alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-1310" alt="2018" src="https://blog.sinequa.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/2018-150x150.jpeg" width="150" height="150" /></a>Sometimes it helps to look at an entire year to gauge just how far you’ve come in a relatively short period of time. Sinequa experienced some very positive developments in 2018 that are worth highlighting. Our software platform evolved on several fronts to help us accelerate our mission to power the information-driven economy. In parallel, our customers demonstrated what the platform can do, even when stretched in creative and unexpected ways.</p>
<h1><span style="text-decoration: underline;">On the Technology Front</span></h1>
<p>The Sinequa platform evolved with some very useful and powerful new capabilities in 2018.</p>
<h2>Content-related Capabilities</h2>
<p>Many of the new capabilities improved on the platform’s ability to integrate with even more enterprise applications and content formats, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>New connectors to support the goal of ubiquitous connectivity across the enterprise. Among these were connectors to Atlassian products to incorporate information from software development projects, including source code files. Also addressed were new versions of popular repositories like SiteCore (a leading web content management platform according to Gartner), along with the likes of Azure storage, AODocs, Beezy, and Teamcenter.</li>
<li>New converters to index more formats like OCR on PDF and Images, AutoCAD and Windchill files, Visio, Improvements on PowerPoint, and a dedicated converter for source code files</li>
<li>Tighter integration with SalesForce.com</li>
<li>In a year full of major data privacy breaches being reported, the Sinequa platform continued to strengthen support of additional levels of encryption like in-flight encryption between all components in a distributed deployment and encryption at indexing time to secure the document cache, which contains elements like HTML preview and thumbnails to better serve customers operating in highly secure environments</li>
</ul>
<h2>Further Automation for the Interpretation of Meaning</h2>
<p>The platform’s ability to interpret the meaning of content also evolved in 2018.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Query Intent</strong>: It is now possible to configure rules to be applied on queries to change the behavior of the underlying search process. This new query intent capability analyzes the query to detect certain words and entities and triggers actions based on the specified rules and classifications. New default entities were also introduced in the platform in 2018 that can be leveraged by the query intent capability and for enrichment during indexing.</li>
<li><strong>Enhanced Linguistics</strong>: There were some language-specific improvements added to the platform to help automate the interpretation of meaning. These included things like enhanced linguistic processing for compound words in French, improved lexical disambiguation in English, enhanced detection of ordinal numbers for Danish &amp; Swedish.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Improvements in Machine Learning</h2>
<p>The year 2018 brought several significant improvements in the Sinequa platform’s ability to leverage machine learning, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>The platform evolved to embed Online Machine Learning, applying machine learning models based on Spark or TensorFlow directly in the indexing pipeline. This represents the first of many new components that can serve machine learning models in real time. Deep learning is also used during indexing to detect new entities or concepts. These are immediately fed into machine learning algorithms, for example in the classification of incoming documents.</li>
<li>Packaged with the platform is a new unsupervised Deep Learning application for text analysis that detects the key words, key phrases, and key sentences of a document.</li>
<li>The platform now supports the Spark 2.3 implementation.</li>
<li>Packaged integration with 3rd party spark distribution providers &#8211; e.g. AWS EMR, HortonWorks.</li>
<li>Battle testing of supervised classification algorithms &#8211; i.e. Sinequa reached a threshold training set size over 10M documents</li>
<li>First machine learning customers are now in production</li>
<li>Packaging of hierarchical classification</li>
<li>Ongoing transition to Software 2.0 paradigm where software is effectively “trained” rather than manually programmed with the packaging of the lifecycle of the model and the model feedback from the search based applications into the Sinequa platform.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Presentation Enhancements for End Users and Admins</h2>
<p>Sinequa invested significantly during 2018 to evolve the way the platform presents insights to end users as well as status information and optional settings to administrators. Here are a couple of the most significant developments:</p>
<ul>
<li>A very exciting development from 2018 involved a complete overhaul of the user interface framework to a responsive design based on Angular 7. This will not only ensure optimal flexibility and performance for end users on all kinds of devices, but will open up Sinequa application development to a much wider audience.</li>
<li>On the Admin front, components have been reshaped to offer administrators of the platform more functionality and a better user experience for their work behind the scenes.</li>
</ul>
<h2><span style="text-decoration: underline;">On the Customer Front</span></h2>
<p>There were a few compelling themes driven by our customer base in 2018, each of which was rewarding in its own way.</p>
<p>Customer satisfaction and retention is a predominant theme for Sinequa. We are extremely pleased by the sheer number of existing satisfied customers that came back to us in 2018 with additional use cases to accelerate their information-driven journey. For instance, business drivers related to governance, risk and compliance with the advent of GDPR and related regulatory demands spurred a lot of activity this past year.</p>
<p>We also had a significant number of customers who experienced that “light bulb moment”, which often occurs when they realize their existing return on Sinequa investment could be significantly amplified by extending the use of the platform with information-driven applications in other parts of the business &#8211; e.g. areas like customer service, R&amp;D, supply chain, and other knowledge-intensive arenas.</p>
<p>We even had a few long-time customers take a pause to re-evaluate their vendor choice and, without exception, decided to double-down on their commitment to Sinequa for years to come.</p>
<p>Of course, the disappearance of the Google Search Appliance brought some new customers into the fold, most of them fiercely determined to go beyond their previous use of a dying application and truly become information-driven.</p>
<p>Possibly the single most exciting development for Sinequa in 2018 was the surge in machine learning projects, which contributed significant business value back to the respective organizations, especially in the Financial Services industry. As the underlying technology matures, we see a steady trend for machine learning projects going from research to production stages. Some of the projects from 2018 focused on applying machine learning models to automate the curation of enterprise content and improve relevance. For example, one customer demonstrated how trained machine learning models could be used to make the enrichment of their enterprise corpus more efficient. It turns out that by proactively identifying what content qualifies as “scientific”, both time and money can be saved by preventing non-scientific content from even being considered for scientific enrichment during ingestion. Another customer took a completely different tack, using machine learning to automatically reproduce confidentiality policies to classify large volumes of banking documents with measurably higher quality at a fraction of the cost they would have spent to do it manually or even with a more traditional rules-based approach.</p>
<h1><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Now it&#8217;s on to 2019!</span></h1>
<p>As we turn the corner into 2019, we are grateful for both the accomplishments of our R&amp;D team and for all of our partners and customers, especially those who provide the challenges, creativity and critical feedback necessary for Sinequa to continue providing the leading platform for information-driven applications and solutions.</p>

<p>“2018 is a fantastic year for Sinequa. Leader for the third time in a row in the <a title="Gartner MQ" href="https://go.sinequa.com/gartner-magic-quadrant-2018.html"  target="_blank">Gartner Magic Quadrant</a> for Insight Engines, we are experiencing triple-digit growth as we continue to expand in North America with the opening of an office in San Francisco, among other major milestones. Winning the KM Promise Award is great validation of the value of our approach and the completeness of our solution. This reaffirms our commitment to offer our customers the most advanced Cognitive Search &amp; Analytics platform to provide them with relevant and contextual insights to make better decisions, drive innovation and achieve greater operational efficiencies,“ said Fanichet.</p>
<p><a href="https://blog.sinequa.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/booth.jpg" ><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1264" alt="booth" src="https://blog.sinequa.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/booth.jpg" width="705" height="750" /></a></p>
<p>In addition to winning the award, we had a very successful show at KMWorld! It was a pleasure to meet with our customers and partners at our brand new lit-up booth and see new faces at the very well-attended keynote presentation from Scott Parker, Sinequa Director of Product Marketing, titled “Becoming an Information-Driven Organization.”</p>
<p><a href="https://blog.sinequa.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/keynote.jpg" ><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1265" alt="keynote" src="https://blog.sinequa.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/keynote.jpg" width="750" height="351" /></a></p>
<p>We look forward to returning to DC next year and adding more trophies to our “honors” shelf in the New York office! In the meantime, we are rounding up 2018 with a few activities – a KMWorld-hosted roundtable webinar on Cognitive Search and Analytics in Action (November 27) and exhibiting sponsorships at the AI World Conference in Boston (December 3-5) and the Forrester Data Strategy &amp; Insights Forum in Orlando (December 4-5).</p>
