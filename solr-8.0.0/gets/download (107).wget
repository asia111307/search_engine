conference venue and two nearby hotels:
<ul>
<li>Fairmont Waterfront Hotel (call +1-866-540-4509 and ask for the Psychonomic rate of $189 CAD + tax - do not try the web site, which says incorrectly that it is sold out)

<h5>Women's event (2018)</h5>

This year, Women in SJDM is trying something new! Instead of the traditional sit-down luncheon on Sunday of the conference, we will be sponsoring the opening SJDM reception on Friday, November 16th. The reception will be divided into two parts. During the first part, attendees will be assigned to several small breakout groups for short periods of time. Groups will be comprised of both junior and senior scholars, and during your time together you will have the opportunity to discuss a variety of professional topics (we will have suggested discussion questions, but feel free to talk about whatever matters to you). Drinks and light snacks will be served to make this event fun and relaxing! The second part of the reception will be open to everyone and feature the standard format of drinks and conversation.

<P>The first part will take place from 4:30 to 6:00 pm. The second part will take place in an adjacent room from 5:30 to 7pm. You must RSVP to attend the first part, but the second part does not require registration. Our hope is that after having some interesting and thought-provoking conversations about professional development, the attendees of the first part of the event will join the second part for more light hearted socializing.

<P><a href="http://chicagobooth.az1.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_9X0PzQALgBcu4oB">Sign up for the event</a>.

<h5>Mailing lists:</h5> 

Members of SJDM are added to the 
<a href="http://mail.sjdm.org/mailman/listinfo/sjdm-members">
<b>sjdm-members</b></a> mailing list, which is for communications about society business such
as meetings and elections. It also provides a password for the members
section of this site and a monthly reminder of it.  This is a very
low-volumue mailing list.
You cannot unsubscribe from it. If you want to quit, see the
Members link above, which also has other options of possible interest.
If you are a member and you are not getting mail about Society
elections and other business, please check the
<a href="http://mail.sjdm.org/mailman/private/sjdm-members/">list archives</a>,
and then (if you missed something recent) check your spam.
If that doesn't help, write <A HREF="mailto:baron@upenn.edu">baron@upenn.edu</a>.

<P>The <a href="http://mail.sjdm.org/mailman/listinfo/jdm-society"><b>jdm-society</b></a>
mailing list is much higher volume and is open to all for reading and posting, but moderated.

<p>DO NOT USE MAILING LIST PASSWORDS FOR ANYTHING ELSE. (And do not try to change them.)
