<h2>Breaking the Last Taboo</h2>
<h3>Review by Thomas J. Bouchard, Jr.</h3>

<P>
"We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created
equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain
inalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty, and the
pursuit of Happiness." With these words Jefferson introduced one of
America's most treasured documents, the Declaration of Independence.
Successive generations of Americans have not only embraced
Jefferson's noble sentiments, they have embellished them. Equality
of political rights and legal standing has been expanded into a
belief in literal equality; today, differences in outcome are taken
as prima facie evidence of unequal opportunity. In an egalitarian
society such as ours, the existence of significant and enduring
individual or group differences in intelligence is seen as a
challenge to our highest ideals. This challenge is taken up by
Richard J. Herrnstein and Charles Murray in <i>The Bell Curve.</i><P>
     <i>The Bell Curve</i> has a simple but powerful thesis: There are
substantial individual and group differences in intelligence; these
differences profoundly influence the social structure and
organization of work in modern industrial societies, and they defy
easy remediation. In the current political milieu, this book's
message is not merely controversial, it is incendiary. As scholars
such as Daniel Moynihan, Arthur Jensen, and E. O. Wilson have
learned, the mainstream media and much of the scientific community
have little tolerance for those who would question our most
cherished beliefs. Herrnstein and Murray have received similar
treatment. They have been cast as racists and elitists, and <i>The
Bell Curve</i> has been dismissed as pseudoscience, ironically by some
commentators who broadly proclaim that their critique has not
benefited from a reading of the book. The book's message cannot be
dismissed so easily. Herrnstein and Murray have written one of the
most provocative social science books published in many years. The
issues raised are likely to be debated by academics and
policymakers for years to come.

<h3>The emergence of a cognitive elite</h3>

<P>
Commentators from across the political spectrum have documented the
profound social changes that all industrialized societies are
undergoing at the end of the 20th century--erosion of the middle class, loss of well-paying manufacturing jobs, and an emerging information age in which individual success will depend on brains not brawn. <i>The Bell Curve</i> tells a similar story regarding the United States. It differs from other works by focusing on intelligence, rather than education or social class as a causal variable. The authors tell us that true educational opportunity as a function of ability (measured by IQ tests) did not arrive in the United States until about 1950. Until that date only about 55 percent of high school graduates in the top IQ quartile went
directly to college. From 1950 to 1960, this number jumped to 72
percent, and in 1980 over 80 percent of graduates in the highest
ability quartile went to college. In addition, sorting by cognitive
ability continues as students move through college. It also occurs
across colleges, with the elite schools selecting the more
intellectually talented students. Finally, it continues across
careers in the world of work. The authors argue that intellectual
stratification through occupations is driven by powerful economic
pressures. This argument is based on a number of different and
compelling lines of evidence. If Herrnstein and Murray are correct,
current social inequalities reflect, in large part, the achievement
of a meritocracy based on cognitive ability.<P>
     The notion of a meritocracy is not, in itself, an affront to
American sensibilities. Social scientists have carefully documented
that social mobility does occur from one generation to the next and
that cognitive ability is a major factor in determining whether an
individual will achieve greater or lesser social status than did
his or her parents (Waller, 1971). When each generation resorts
in this way, the elements of fairness and opportunity are
preserved. If, however, as <i>The Bell Curve</i> asserts, the heritability
of IQ is quite high and there is a strong tendency for those
similar in ability to marry, there will be less regression toward
the mean in the cognitive ability of children of the intellectually
talented and, therefore, less intergenerational reassortment. Under
these circumstances a meritocracy begins to look like an
aristocracy, a perception that is strongly reinforced when the
intellectual elite segregate themselves from the rest of society by
living in separate neighborhoods, sending their children to private
schools, and supporting social institutions that cater to their own
unique interests.<P>
     The authors do argue that general cognitive ability (i.e.,
"<i>g</i>") is a major determiner of social status and that variance in
general mental ability is largely attributable to genetic
factors--propositions that are certainly endorsed by many experts
in the field. The book explicitly disclaims, however, that general
mental ability is the only determinant of social status, or that <i>g</i>
is the sum total of an individual's social worth.<P>

<h3>The role of social class of origin</h3>

<P>
<i>The Bell Curve</i> carefully documents in table after table, graph
after graph that cognitive ability has become a more important
determinant of social status than social class of origin. Although
this may come as a surprise to many, it is consistent with a large
body of evidence. Research methodology in the domain of individual differences has changed dramatically in the past 20 years. Many
investigators in this domain now accept two major methodological
principles: that single studies based on small samples are
inherently uninformative and that correlations calculated from data
gathered within biological families are seriously confounded.
Understanding both of these principles is important when evaluating
evidence often brought to bear against <i>The Bell Curve.</i><P>
     Results from a single modest study carry little more weight
than does a single anecdote, no matter how compelling the finding.
Most social scientists, but certainly not all, have adopted the
methodology of meta-analysis, a statistical tool that
systematically combines the results from many studies to provide a
single reliable conclusion. In a similar fashion, behavioral
geneticists combine the results from numerous kinships weighted by
their sample sizes to provide the best estimate of the degree of
environmental and genetic influence on any particular trait. Any
single study is viewed as providing only weak evidence on its
own.<P>
     The confound generated by data drawn from within biological
families provides numerous pitfalls when assessing this book's
claims and reviewers' counterclaims. Within a biological family,
correlations (e.g., parental socioeconomic status x child's IQ) are
ambiguous because the cause of the correlation could be the family
environment or the parent's genes. Within biological families, the
correlation between parental socioeconomic status (SES) and child's
IQ, based on a meta-analysis of the literature, is .333 (White,
1982). However, in studies where genetic effects are held constant,
through twin or adoption designs, the correlation drops
dramatically (Bouchard, Lykken, McGue, Segal, & Tellegen, 1990;
Scarr & Weinberg, 1978). Another striking exemplar of this
phenomenon is the IQ correlation between unrelated individuals
reared together who share a common family environment but lack a
common genetic background. When the cognitive ability of these
"unrelated siblings" is measured in adulthood the correlation is
zero (McGue, Bouchard, Iacono, & Lykken, 1993). Thus the
correlation between parental SES and offspring IQ in biological
families is due, in some measure, to genetic endowment.
Consequently, when examining the relationship between IQ and a
dependent variable, to "hold constant" the SES of biological
parents (on the grounds that SES is a competing "environmental
explanation") results in an underestimate of the true influence of
IQ. As early as 1970, Paul Meehl warned that "the commonest error
in handling nuisance variables of the `status' sort (e.g., income,
education, locale, marriage) is the error of suppressing
statistically components of variance that, being genetic, ought not
be thus arbitrarily relegated to the `spurious influence' category"
(pp. 393-394). In this book, intended for lay readers as well as
academicians, the authors have purposefully provided simple and
straightforward analyses of SES and cognitive ability. They have,
in many instances, understated the role of cognitive ability by
holding SES constant. We can expect to see numerous reanalyses and
the presentation of many more complex models derived to support
both sides of the debate. The careful reader will remember Meehl's
caution when examining the data and drawing conclusions.<P>

<h3>Cognitive classes and social behavior</h3>

<P>
Part II of <i>The Bell Curve</i> reviews the role of cognitive ability in
areas of social dysfunction. In this section, the data are more
complicated, conclusions more equivocal. In spite of claims to the
contrary by some reviewers, the book makes it clear that with
regard to the issues discussed in this section of the book (e.g.,
poverty, schooling, unemployment, idleness and injury, family
matters, welfare dependency, parenting, crime, civility, and
citizenship), IQ "almost always explains less than 20 percent of
the variance, . . . usually less than 10 percent and often
less than 5 percent" (p. 117). These analyses deal only with
non-Latino Whites and make use of the National Longitudinal Survey
of Labor Market Experience of Youth (NLSY). This large nationally
representative survey, begun in 1979, incorporated the Armed Forces
Qualification Test (AFQT). The AFQT provides an excellent measure
of <i>g,</i> and the survey contains sufficiently detailed information
that questions regarding the influence of <i>g</i> on the outcomes listed
above can now be addressed systematically.<P>
     I discuss the results regarding poverty as an exemplar. First,
it must be noted that the decline in poverty from 1940 to 1970 is
dramatic and linear, dropping from over 50 percent to less than 15
percent. It has remained nearly constant since 1970. This means
that the rise in crime, drug abuse, and many other discontents over
the past 25 years cannot be ascribed to poverty per se. It also
means the analyses in <i>The Bell Curve</i> are being carried out on a
very different population than would have been used had the
analysis been carried out before 1970. Consequently, comparisons
with earlier research are problematical. The evidence strongly
supports the conclusion that high IQ is an important protective
factor, and low IQ is an important risk factor. Parental SES is not
nearly as protective or nearly as debilitating. IQ has an effect
even when education is held constant. When one looks at poverty
among women with children, the situation is quite different. For
separated, divorced, or never married White mothers with very low
IQs, the probability of being in poverty is almost 70 percent. For
the same group of mothers with very high IQs, the risk of poverty
is about 10 percent. For married mothers, however, the range is
from under 20 percent to near zero. IQ is influential, but marriage
is clearly more important. Thus poverty among children is strongly
associated with the marital status of their mothers. Holding IQ
constant washes out any influence of parental SES for both types of
mothers but leaves a large marital effect. Similar empirical
demonstrations, with numerous twists and turns, are made regarding
the other dependent variables enumerated above.<P>

<h3>The national context</h3>

<P>
Part III of <i>The Bell Curve</i> contains the most controversial chapter
in the book, "Ethnic Differences in Cognitive Ability." The data
reviewed here are neither new nor surprising and find strong
support in the current psychological literature (Humphreys, 1988).
East Asians, living in Asia or America, score above White Americans
in tests of cognitive ability; the best estimate of that difference
 is about three points with findings ranging from no difference to
a 10-point spread in test scores. The difference in measured IQ
between African Americans and Whites has remained at about 15 IQ
points for decades, although there is some indication of very
modest convergence due to fewer low scores in the African American
population. Controlling for SES reduces but does not eliminate this
difference, and of course, controlling for SES in ethnic group
contrasts may eliminate a valid source of IQ variance. Moreover,
ethnic differences on cognitive tests cannot be attributed to test
bias.<P>
     As described earlier, <i>The Bell Curve</i> asserts that differences
in cognitive ability between individuals are due in part to
differences in their genetic endowment. A great deal of research
supports this conclusion (Bouchard, 1993; Pedersen, Plomin,
Nesselroade, & McClearn, 1992). The question is, What can we
infer from these findings about the origins of ethnic group
differences? As any graduate student knows, the source of
individual differences in a trait cannot be taken as evidence for
the source of group differences in the same trait. A great deal of
indirect evidence points to both genetic and environmental
contributions to ethnic group differences in IQ. None of this
evidence, however, is as firm as the evidence for genetic influence
on individual differences in IQ. Many experts in the field
(Snyderman & Rothman, 1988) agree with Herrnstein and Murray
when they state that "it seems highly likely to us that both genes
and the environment have something to do with racial differences.
What might the mix be? We are resolutely agnostic on the issue; as
far as we can determine, the evidence does not yet justify an
estimate" (p. 311).<P>

<h3>Science, ethics, and social policy</h3>

<P>
<i>The Bell Curve</i> closes with a review of the policy implications of
their findings. What is the role of the social scientist in the
formulation of social policy? I agree with Kendler (1993) that it
is clearly within the scientific realm to comment on the likely
consequences of competing social policies. Judging the value, as
opposed to the costs, of such policies is, however, a matter of
political rather than scientific discourse. As Kendler documents,
many social scientists confuse these two functions. Herrnstein and
Murray have been vigorously chastised for discussing policy
implications on the basis of the work reviewed and the data
analyzed in their book. Similar assertions are, however, regularly
made by many investigators in the social sciences. For example, the
implications of specific research projects are regularly found in
grant applications where they are used to justify the request for
funds. Seldom are the value judgments underlying these implications
explicitly stated, but they are easily inferred. Herrnstein and
Murray have, in my opinion, been much more "up front" about these
matters than many social scientists, and their discussions fall
clearly within the boundaries discussed by Kendler. They argue, for
example, with regard to affirmative action, "Our contribution
(we hope) is to calibrate the policy choices associated with
affirmative action, to make costs and benefits clearer than they
usually are" (pp. 387-388).<p>
     In writing the Declaration of Independence, Jefferson was
attempting to give birth to a shared political goal--freedom, as
expressed in the right to life, liberty, and the pursuit of
happiness. Herrnstein and Murray also address this important theme.
They make it clear that a meritocracy need not be a Darwinian
jungle and that a responsible society should make a place for
everyone. Their description of the ideal meritocracy will not be to
everyone's taste, but it is neither more foolish nor more naive
than many proposals that have been suggested in the past.
Nevertheless, predicting the future is an extremely hazardous
enterprise. We have recently seen the virtual collapse of a number
of societies that were based on a totally different conception of
human nature than that underlying <i>The Bell Curve.</i> Virtually no one
predicted this dramatic outcome for one of history's largest social
experiments. Undoubtedly, Herrnstein and Murray's arguments are
wrong in some of the details, and they may be wrong about the
larger picture. Nevertheless, one of the goals of the intellectual
enterprise is to question received wisdom, to ask difficult
questions, and to seek novel and "better" solutions to both new and
old problems. They have succeeded admirably at this task.<P>
     This is a superbly written and exceedingly well-documented
book. It raises many troubling questions regarding the organization
of our society. It deserves the attention of every well-informed
and thoughtful citizen.<P>

<h2>Soft Science With a Neoconservative Agenda</h2>
<h3>Review by Donald D. Dorfman</h3>

<P>
"Is there a danger that current welfare policies, unaided by
eugenic foresight, could lead to the genetic enslavement of a
substantial segment of our population? The possible consequences of
our failure seriously to study these questions may well be viewed
by future generations as our society's greatest injustice to Negro
Americans" (Jensen, 1969, p. 95).<P>
     So said Arthur Jensen in 1969 in a <i>Harvard
Educational Review</i> article on race and general intelligence. General
intelligence is often called IQ for short. In the most
controversial parts of <i>The Bell Curve,</i> a book written for the
general reader, Richard J. Herrnstein and Charles Murray present
much the same theories and general concerns as did Jensen with
regard to Black cognitive intelligence, while extending the
analysis to include Latinos. They greatly expand on the evidence,
present possible causal links between IQ and socially undesirable
behaviors, and at the end of the book suggest implications for
public policy. They are especially worried about a supposed
downward pressure on the distribution of IQ in the United States,
which they call dysgenic pressure. <i>Dysgenic</i> is a term borrowed from
population biology. As does Jensen, the authors believe that Blacks
"are experiencing even more severe dysgenic pressures than Whites"
(p. 341). Part of the problem may be differences in reproductive
strategies among the races, according to J. Philippe Rushton's
theory discussed in the book (pp. 642-643). Herrnstein and Murray
mention Rushton's theory that Blacks have the largest genitals and
the highest frequency of sexual intercourse among the three major
races (p. 642). Consistent with customary academic standards of
scholarly objectivity and neutrality, Herrnstein and Murray reserve
judgment on whether Rushton is right or wrong: "We expect that time
will tell whether it [Rushton's theory] is right or wrong in fact"
(p. 643).<P>
     In addition to supposed downward pressures on the distribution
of intelligence in this country produced by high fertility rates in
Blacks, Herrnstein and Murray believe that Latinos are also
experiencing more severe dysgenic pressures than Whites (p. 341)
and that Latino immigration is putting downward pressure on the
distribution of American national intelligence. So should we be
worrying about dysgenic pressure on our national cognitive
intelligence? They conclude, "Putting the pieces together--higher
fertility and a faster generational cycle among the less
intelligent and an immigrant population that is probably somewhat
below the native-born average--the case is strong that something
worth worrying about is happening to the cognitive capital of the
country" (p. 364).<P>
     The authors present a large number of research analyses that
they performed themselves, in which they pit parental socioeconomic
 status (SES) against IQ on a variety of economic and social
behaviors. They conclude that the major cause of economic and
social behaviors is IQ, not SES. The authors' research analyses are
based on data collected in the National Longitudinal Survey of
Youth (NLSY). None of their research analyses on the relation
between IQ, SES, and social behaviors has ever been published in
peer-reviewed scientific journals. <i>The Bell Curve</i> is written for
the general reader and does not assume that the reader has had a
course in statistics. The authors have even included an appendix
for those readers who are sure they can not learn statistics,
titled "Statistics for People Who Are Sure They Can't Learn
Statistics" (Appendix 1, pp. 553-567). Scientists first publish
their research in peer-reviewed scientific journals, not in books
written for the general reader who may not have the technical
background needed to detect flaws in data and misinterpretations of
data analyses. It is inappropriate for a scientist to do
otherwise.<P>
     Herrnstein and Murray's research analyses--never published in
peer-reviewed scientific journals--investigate the relation of IQ
and SES to marriage, to divorce, to illegitimacy, to welfare
dependency, and to parenting. They conclude that IQ is the primary
problem, not SES: "People with low cognitive ability tend to be
worse parents" (p. 232). The authors believe that low birth weight
and high infant mortality are indications of poor parenting and are
probably caused by "prenatal negligence" (p. 233) on the part of
mothers with low cognitive ability rather than inadequate prenatal
medical care on the part of society. They also present unpublished
research analyses on the relation between crime and low cognitive
intelligence, and between civility and high cognitive intelligence.
"A smarter population is more likely to be, and more capable of
being made into, a civil citizenry" (p. 266), according to the
authors.<P>
     In the final part of <i>The Bell Curve,</i> titled "Living Together,"
Herrnstein and Murray propose a solution to the supposed dysgenic
downward pressures on our national intelligence caused by the large
number of children born to "low-IQ women," and to the recent
large-scale Latino immigrations to the United States. They argue
that America's current fertility policy "subsidizes births among
poor women, who are disproportionately at the low end of the
intelligence distribution" (p. 548). They seem to urge eugenic
foresight to counteract dysgenic pressure: "We urge generally that
these policies, represented by the extensive network of cash and
services for low-income women who have babies, be ended" (p. 548).
With regard to the supposed dysgenic effects of Latino immigration
on national intelligence, their central thought about immigration
"is that present policy assumes an indifference to the individual
characteristics of immigrants that no society can indefinitely
maintain without danger" (p. 549). "But," they conclude, "we believe
that the main purpose of immigration law should be to serve
America's interests" (p. 549). For those members of groups who will
not be excluded from the American dream by eugenic foresight or new
immigration laws, Herrnstein and Murray propose "that group
differences in cognitive ability, so desperately denied for so
long, can best be handled--can <i>only</i> be handled--by a return to
individualism" (p. 550).<p>
     Who are the authors of <i>The Bell Curve?</i> Are they right? The
first author, Richard Herrnstein, was a professor of psychology at
Harvard University for 36 years. He died a very short time ago. One
would presume that <i>The Bell Curve</i> represents Herrnstein's final
summing up of a lifetime of objective scholarly research published
in peer-reviewed scientific journals on the genetic basis of IQ.
Regrettably, the media seem to be totally unaware of the fact that
the deceased Harvard professor never published any scientific
research on the genetic basis of IQ and its relation to race,
poverty, or social class in peer-reviewed scientific journals in
his entire 36-year academic career. Richard Herrnstein's actual area
of expertise is the experimental analysis of decision making in
pigeons and rats, and he never studied the genetic basis of any
behavior in those laboratory animals. The first presentation of his
theory on the genetic basis of IQ, social class, and poverty
appeared in a magazine article titled "I.Q." published in the
September 1971 issue of the <i>Atlantic Monthly</i> magazine. As we all
know, scientists publish their data and theories in peer-reviewed
scientific journals or in peer-reviewed technical books, not in
popular magazines or in nontechnical books written for the general
reader.<P>
     In 1973, Herrnstein published a nontechnical Atlantic Monthly
Press book titled <i>I.Q. in the Meritocracy</i> that expanded on his
theory of the genetic basis of IQ and poverty. Herrnstein had never
collected data on IQ, so the book drew on the work of others,
especially the "data" of Sir Cyril Burt. According to Leslie
Hearnshaw (1979), Burt's biographer and distinguished historian of
British psychology, Burt had probably invented much of his highly
cited data on the genetic basis of IQ. While doing research on
Burt's data for an article that I later published in <i>Science</i>
(1978), I discovered that Herrnstein had in fact laundered Burt's
own descriptions of Burt's widely publicized and highly cited study
"Intelligence and Social Mobility" (Burt, 1961). Burt had described
his own study "merely as a pilot inquiry" (p. 9) and his data as
"crude and limited" (p. 9). Burt had not even reported the number
of subjects he had tested in his crude and limited study. In
describing Burt's study, however, Herrnstein (1973) failed to tell
the reader about the deficiencies that Burt, himself, had
mentioned. In addition, Herrnstein (1973) said Burt's sample size
was "1,000" (p. 203), later revising that figure to "40,000" in
response to criticism. In reply to a critical letter by Jerry
Hirsch (1975), Herrnstein (1975) revised his 1973 figure: "It is
true that Burt's sample was 40,000, not 1,000 as I said" (p. 436),
while failing to acknowledge that Burt had never reported the
number of subjects he had tested. Leon Kamin (1974) appears to have
been the only psychologist to notice and publicly report that Burt
had failed to give the sample size of his celebrated 1961 study of
IQ and social mobility. Presumably, Herrnstein and other
psychologists who had publicized the results of that study had
never noticed that Burt had not reported the sample size of his
famous study.<P>
     The second author of <i>The Bell Curve,</i> Charles Murray, has a doctorate in political science from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and is currently a Bradley Fellow with the American Enterprise Institute, a conservative research group in Washington, DC. Murray often publishes his research and theories in <i>The Public Interest</i> (e.g., Murray, 1994), a neoconservative magazine edited by Irving Kristol, also a fellow of the American Enterprise Institute and sometimes considered the founding father of neoconservatism (Atlas, 1995). In an article recently published in <i>The Public Interest,</i> Murray listed the first priority of his political agenda: "And so I want to end welfare" (1994, p. 18). Inasmuch as the media sometimes refer to <i>The Bell Curve</i> as Murray's book, perhaps the book represents Murray's summing up of a body of objective scholarly research that he had published in scientific journals on the genetic basis of IQ and poverty. But like his coauthor Richard Herrnstein, Murray has never conducted or published any research in scientific journals on the genetic basis of IQ and poverty in his entire career.<P>
     <i>The Bell Curve</i> is not a scientific work. It was not written by
experts, and it has a specific political agenda. Still, it is
possible that the major scientific premises of the book may be
correct. If two monkeys were put before a typewriter, it is
theoretically possible for those two monkeys to produce a
Shakespearean sonnet. Perhaps Herrnstein and Murray produced a
valid scientific work. I will now evaluate the major premises of
<i>The Bell Curve.</i><P>

<h3>The rewriting of history: The Burt affair</h3>

<P>
In 1972, Leon Kamin exposed the empirical unsoundness of the most
important evidence in support of the IQ hereditarian position, Sir
Cyril Burt's data (Hearnshaw, 1979). He later published his results
in a book attacking Burt's data as well as the secondary sources
who publicized those data (Kamin, 1974). In 1979, Leslie Hearnshaw
(1979) published a biography of Burt in which he concluded on the
basis of personal diaries and other material that it was highly
likely that Burt had fabricated some of his most celebrated data.
Hearnshaw, distinguished historian of British psychology, delivered
the memorial address at Burt's Memorial Service and was later asked
by Marion Burt, Burt's sister, to write a full-length biography of
Burt. The result was the well-known <i>Cyril Burt: Psychologist</i>
(1979). In their discussion of the Burt affair, Herrnstein and
Murray suggest that some of Burt's "leading critics were aware that
their accusations were inaccurate" (p. 12), suggesting a possible
conspiracy against Burt. There is, however, no mention whatsoever
of Hearnshaw's book in their half-page synopsis of the Burt affair,
and Hearnshaw's book does not appear anywhere in their 57-page
bibliography of references. This misrepresentation of the Burt affair
by omission of important historical facts is not uniquely
associated with <i>The Bell Curve.</i> In 1982, Richard Herrnstein
published an article in <i>The Atlantic Monthly</i> in which he attacked
the media for misrepresenting the evidence in the IQ controversy
(Herrnstein, 1982). In that magazine article, the Harvard professor
wrote "that most psychometricians had stopped trusting Burt's data
years before, partly because of inconsistencies first noted in a

<h3>Does the distribution of IQs follow a bell curve?</h3>

<P>
The distribution of IQ test scores cannot be expected to follow a
bell curve unless it is constructed by the tester to do so
(Dorfman, 1978). The shape of the distribution of IQ test scores
will depend on the average difficulty of the test items as well as
their intercorrelations. The high item intercorrelations in IQ
tests imply that the IQ distribution can take a variety of shapes.
The central limit theorem does not apply to random variables with
positive intercorrelations (Lamperti, 1966). Frederic Lord (1952),
one of the fathers of modern test theory and former president of
the Psychometric Society, gave results on this question: "The
results given are sufficient to show that the distribution of test
scores cannot in general be expected to be normal, or even
approximately normal. The question naturally arises as to what
possible shapes the frequency distribution <i>f</i>s, as given in (76) [Lord's
Equation (76)], may assume. The answer is that this function may
assume any shape whatsoever, provided the item intercorrelations
are sufficiently high" (Lord, 1952, pp. 32-33). The symbol <i>f</i>s
refers to the distribution of test scores.<P>

<h3>Does cognitive ability consist of a single general factor?</h3>

<P>
The book uses factor analysis to infer the existence of a single
hypothetical general factor of cognitive intelligence that is
presumed to account for most of cognitive performance. One of the
problems with factor analysis as a tool for determining the
underlying structure of a system is that neither the factors
nor the loadings are uniquely defined if you have more than one
factor (Lawley & Maxwell, 1963), and it is difficult to
determine if you have only one factor. In experimental cognitive
psychology, factor analysis is virtually never used as a tool to
determine the underlying cognitive structure. It is a tool for
correlational cognitive psychology, not experimental cognitive
psychology. I inspected the subject index of some well-known texts
in experimental cognitive psychology and found that the term <i>factor
analysis</i> never appears in the subject index (e.g., see Anderson,
1985; Matlin, 1994; Reed, 1982). Why not? Kendall and Stuart
(1966) may provide the answer: "Application of the same technique
[factor analysis] to physical systems very often results in
weighted sums of variables to which no clear interpretation can be
given" (p. 310). In short, "The main difficulty, as a rule, is to
know what the results mean" (p. 310), Kendall and Stuart point
out.<P>

<h3>Can you measure the heritability of IQ?</h3>

<P>
The most direct way of estimating heritability is from data on
monozygotic twins reared apart (MZA) and separated in early infancy
(Bouchard, Lykken, McGue, Segal, & Tellegen, 1990). This MZA
design allows for the estimation of heritability if the following
major assumptions are met: (a) environments are a random sample
from the population of environments, (b) genotypes are a random
sample from the population of genotypes, (c) there is no genotype-environment correlation, and (d) there is no genotype-environment interaction. If the pairs of MZAs differ in age, then these assumptions will not be met. If these assumptions are met, then the intraclass
correlation between IQ scores of MZA twin pairs directly measures
heritability. Sir Cyril Burt's (1966) study of 53 MZAs appears to
have met the first <i>three</i> assumptions. Unfortunately, Burt's data
appear to have been invented (Hearnshaw, 1979). Bouchard et al.'s
(Minnesota) survey of MZAs provides the next best data set.
Unfortunately, to the best of my knowledge, the detailed case-study
records of the Minnesota MZAs have never been released and have
therefore not been subjected to public scrutiny to determine the
degree to which assumptions have been met and the degree to which
the MZAs told the truth to the Minnesota group. Finally, if there
is genotype-environment interaction--then the fourth assumption is
not met--and heritability is undefined. But this is the most
controversial assumption underlying the MZA design. Herrnstein and
Murray present no convincing evidence to justify the fourth
assumption.<P>

<h3>Does high within-group heritability of IQ imply between-group
heritability of IQ?</h3>

<P>
The authors have made a fundamental error well-known by
professional geneticists. It is sometimes called <i>"Jensen's error."</i>
Jensen made that error in his famous 1969 <i>Harvard Educational
Review</i> article. The critical importance of that error was first
clearly illuminated by Roger Milkman, a professor of biology at the
University of Iowa and a world authority on population genetics and
evolutionary biology. The article, "A Simple Exposition of Jensen's
Error," was published in the <i>Journal of Educational Statistics</i> in
1978 (Milkman, 1978). Melvin Novick was editor of that journal when
Milkman's article was published. Novick, professor of statistics
and education at the University of Iowa at the time, later became
president of the Psychometric Society. What is Jensen's error? It
is that within-race heritability has no implications for
between-race heritability. <i>The Bell Curve</i> is therefore flawed with
regard to inferring between-race heritability in IQ from
within-race heritability in IQ.<P>

<h3>Does IQ or SES cause socially undesirable behaviors?
</h3>

<P>
Herrnstein and Murray use logistic regression to determine which is
more important--IQ or SES--in determining socially undesirable
behaviors. Logistic regression is a form of regression in which the
dependent variable is binary. In all of their analyses, they assume
a simple additive model in which the logit (a transform of the
sample proportion) is assumed to equal B0 + B1IQ + B2SES + B3 age + random residual [numbers after Bs should read as subscripts]. They assume no IQ-SES interaction. They use the standardized beta weights to determine the relative importance of IQ and SES in determining the probability of various undesirable or desirable behaviors. Unfortunately, IQ and SES are highly intercorrelated (collinearity).<P>
     There are two major problems with Herrnstein and Murray's attempts to determine whether IQ or SES is more important. First, there is the collinearity problem. Weisberg (1985) describes the collinearity problem in linear regression: "When the predictors are related to each other, regression modeling can be very confusing. Estimated effects can change magnitude or even sign depending on the other predictors in the model" (p. 196). Next, there is the problem of deciding that the predictor with the largest standardized beta weight is the most important. Weisberg describes
why this approach is faulty: "Unfortunately, this logic is faulty
because the scaling depends on the range of values for the
variables in the data" (p. 186). Perhaps these are the reasons why
Herrnstein and Murray never published their logistic analyses in peer-reviewed journals.<P>
     Were Herrnstein and Murray as lucky as the proverbial monkeys
at a typewriter? That depends on your point of view.<P>
