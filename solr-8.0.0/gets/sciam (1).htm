<P>In 1986 Nadean Cool, a nurse's aide in Wisconsin, sought therapy from a psychiatrist to help 
her cope with her reaction to a traumatic event experienced by her daughter. During therapy, 
the psychiatrist used hypnosis and other suggestive techniques to dig out buried memories of 
abuse that Cool herself had allegedly experienced. In the process, Cool became convinced that 
she had repressed memories of having been in a satanic cult, of eating babies, of being raped, 
of having sex with animals and of being forced to watch the murder of her eight-year-old friend. 
She came to believe that she had more than 120 personalities-children, adults, angels and even 
a duck-all because, Cool was told, she had experienced severe childhood sexual and physical abuse. 
The psychiatrist also performed exorcisms on her, one of which lasted for five hours and included
the sprinkling of holy water and screams for Satan to leave Cool's body.<BR><BR>
When Cool finally realized that false memories had been planted, she sued the psychiatrist for 
malpractice. In March 1997, after five weeks of trial, her case was settled out of court for 
$2.4 million.
Nadean Cool is not the only patient to develop false memories as a result of questionable 
therapy. In Missouri in 1992 a church counselor helped Beth Rutherford to remember during 
therapy that her father, a clergyman, had regularly raped her between the ages of seven and 14 
and that her mother sometimes helped him by holding her down. Under her therapist's guidance, 
Rutherford developed memories of her father twice impregnating her and forcing her to abort
the fetus herself with a coat hanger.The father had to resign from his post as a clergyman when 
the allegations were made public. Later medical examination of the daughter revealed, however, 
that she was still a virgin at age 22 and had never been pregnant. The daughter sued the 
therapist and received a $1-million settlement in 1996.<BR><BR>
About a year earlier two juries returned verdicts against a Minnesota psychiatrist accused of 
planting false memories by former patients Vynnette Hamanne and Elizabeth Carlson, who under 
hypnosis and sodium amytal, and after being fed misinformation about the workings of memory, 
had come to remember horrific abuse by family members. The juries awarded Hammane $2.67 million 
and Carlson $2.5 million for their ordeals.<BR><BR>
In all four cases, the women developed memories about childhood abuse in therapy and then later 
denied their authenticity. How can we determine if memories of childhood abuse are true or false?
Without corroboration, it is very difficult to differentiate between false memories and true ones. 
Also, in these cases, some memories were contrary to physical evidence, such as explicit and 
detailed recollections of rape and abortion when medical examination confirmed virginity. How is
it possible for people to acquire elaborate and confident false memories? A growing number of 
investigations demonstrate that under the right circumstances false memories can be instilled 
rather easily in some people.<BR><BR>
My own research into memory distortion goes back to the early 1970s, when I began studies of the 
"misinformation effect." These studies show that when people who witness an event are later 
exposed to new and misleading information about it, their recollections often become distorted. 
In one example, participants viewed a simulated automobile accident at an intersection with a 
stop sign. After the viewing, half the participants received a suggestion that the traffic sign 
was a yield sign. When asked later what traffic sign they remembered seeing at the intersection, 
those who had been given the suggestion tended to claim that they had seen a yield sign. Those 
who had not received the phony information were much more accurate in their recollection of the 
traffic sign.<BR><BR>
My students and I have now conducted more than 200 experiments involving over 20,000 individuals 
that document how exposure to misinformation induces memory distortion. In these studies, people 
"recalled" a conspicuous barn in a bucolic scene that contained no buildings at all, broken glass
and tape recorders that were not in the scenes they viewed, a white instead of a blue vehicle in 
a crime scene, and Minnie Mouse when they actually saw Mickey Mouse. Taken together, these 
studies show that misinformation can change an individual's recollection in predictable and 
sometimes very powerful ways.<BR><BR>
Misinformation has the potential for invading our memories when we talk to other people, when we 
are suggestively interrogated or when we read or view media coverage about some event that we may
have experienced ourselves. After more than two decades of exploring the power of misinformation,
researchers have learned a great deal about the conditions that make people susceptible to memory
modification. Memories are more easily modified, for instance, when the passage of time allows 
the original memory to fade.<BR><BR>

<H4 ALIGN=CENTER> False Childhood Memories </H4>

<P>It is one thing to change a detail or two in an otherwise intact memory but quite another to 
plant a false memory of an event that never happened. To study false memory, my students and I
first had to find a way to plant a pseudomemory that would not cause our subjects undue emotional
stress, either in the process of creating the false memory or when we revealed that they had been
intentionally deceived. Yet we wanted to try to plant a memory that would be at least mildly 
traumatic, had the experience actually happened.<BR><BR>
My research associate, Jacqueline E. Pickrell, and I settled on trying to plant a specific 
memory of being lost in a shopping mall or large department store at about the age of five. 
Here's how we did it. We asked our subjects, 24 individuals ranging in age from 18 to 53, to try 
to remember childhood events that had been recounted to us by a parent, an older sibling or 
another close relative. We prepared a booklet for each participant containing one-paragraph 
stories about three events that had actually happened to him or her and one that had not. 
We constructed the false event using information about a plausible shopping trip provided by a 
relative, who also verified that the participant had not in fact been lost at about the age of 
five. The lost-in-the-mall scenario included the following elements: lost for an extended period,
crying, aid and comfort by an elderly woman and, finally, reunion with the family.</UL>

<IMG ALIGN=LEFT SRC="image3.gif" VSPACE=5>

<P>After reading each story in the booklet, the participants wrote what they remembered about 
the event. If they did not remember it, they were instructed to write, "I do not remember this."
In two follow-up interviews, we told the participants that we were interested in examining how 
much detail they could remember and how their memories compared with those of their relative. 
The event paragraphs were not read to them verbatim, but rather parts were provided as retrieval 
cues. The participants recalled something about 49 of the 72 true events (68 percent) immediately
after the initial reading of the booklet and also in each of the two follow-up interviews. After 
reading the booklet, seven of the 24 participants (29 percent) remembered either partially or 
fully the false event constructed for them, and in the two follow-up interviews six participants
(25 percent) continued to claim that they remembered the fictitious event. Statistically, there 
were some differences between the true memories and the false ones: participants used more words 
to describe the true memories, and they rated the true memories as being somewhat more clear. 
But if an onlooker were to observe many of our participants describe an event, it would be 
difficult indeed to tell whether the account was of a true or a false memory. Of course, being 
lost, however frightening, is not the same as being abused. But the lost-in-the-mall study is 
not about real experiences of being lost; it is about planting false memories of being lost. 
The paradigm shows a way of instilling false memories and takes a step toward allowing us to 
understand how this might happen in real-world settings. Moreover, the study provides evidence 
that people can be led to remember their past in different ways, and they can even be coaxed 
into "remembering" entire events that never happened.<BR><BR>
Studies in other laboratories using a similar experimental procedure have produced similar 
results. For instance, Ira Hyman, Troy H. Husband and F. James Billing of Western Washington 
University asked college students to recall childhood experiences that had been recounted by 
their parents. The researchers told the students that the study was about how people remember 
shared experiences differently. In addition to actual events reported by parents, each 
participant was given one false event either an overnight hospitalization for a high fever and 
a possible ear infection, or a birthday party with pizza and a clown that supposedly happened 
at about the age of five. The parents confirmed that neither of these events actually took place.</UL>

<IMG ALIGN=LEFT SRC="image4.gif" VSPACE=5>

<P>Hyman found that students fully or partially recalled 84 percent of the true events in the 
first interview and 88 percent in the second interview. None of the participants recalled the 
false event during the first interview, but 20 percent said they remembered something about the 
false event in the second interview. One participant who had been exposed to the emergency 
hospitalization story later remembered a male doctor, a female nurse and a friend from church 
who came to visit at the hospital. In another study, along with true events Hyman presented 
different false events, such as accidentally spilling a bowl of punch on the parents of the 
bride at a wedding reception or having to evacuate a grocery store when the overhead sprinkler 
systems erroneously activated. Again, none of the participants recalled the false event during 
the first interview, but 18 percent remembered something about it in the second interview. 
For example, during the first interview, one participant, when asked about the fictitious 
wedding event, stated, "I have no clue. I have never heard that one before." In the second 
interview, the participant said, "It was an outdoor wedding, and I think we were running around 
and knocked something over like the punch bowl or something and made a big mess and of course 
got yelled at for it. "<BR><BR>

<H4 ALIGN=CENTER> Imagination Inflation </H4>

<P>The finding that an external suggestion can lead to the construction of false childhood 
memories helps us understand the process by which false memories arise. It is natural to wonder 
whether this research is applicable in real situations such as being interrogated by law officers
or in psychotherapy. Although strong suggestion may not routinely occur in police questioning 
or therapy, suggestion in the form of an imagination exercise sometimes does. For instance, 
when trying to obtain a confession, law officers may ask a suspect to imagine having participated
in a criminal act. Some mental health professionals encourage patients to imagine childhood 
events as a way of recovering supposedly hidden memories.</UL>

<IMG ALIGN=LEFT SRC="image5.gif" VSPACE=5>

<P>Surveys of clinical psychologists reveal that 11 percent instruct their clients to 
"let the imagination run wild," and 22 percent tell their clients to "give free rein to the 
imagination." Therapist Wendy Maltz, author of a popular book on childhood sexual abuse, 
advocates telling the patient: "Spend time imaging that you were sexually abused, without 
worrying about accuracy proving anything, or having your ideas make sense .... Ask yourself ... 
these questions: What time of day is it? Where are you? Indoors or outdoors? What kind of things 
are happening? Is there one or more person with you?" Maltz further recommends that therapists 
continue to ask questions such as "Who would have been likely perpetrators? When were you most 
vulnerable to sexual abuse in your life?"<BR><BR>
The increasing use of such imagination exercises led me and several colleagues to wonder about 
their consequences. What happens when people imagine childhood experiences that did not happen 
to them? Does imagining a childhood event increase confidence that it occurred? To explore this, 
we designed a three-stage procedure. We first asked individuals to indicate the likelihood that 
certain events happened to them during their childhood. The list contains 40 events, each rated 
on a scale ranging from "definitely did not happen" to "definitely did happen." Two weeks later 
we asked the participants to imagine that they had experienced some of these events. Different 
subjects were asked to imagine different events. Sometime later the participants again were asked
to respond to the original list of 40 childhood events, indicating how likely it was that these 
events actually happened to them. Consider one of the imagination exercises. Participants are 
told to imagine playing inside at home after school, hearing a strange noise outside, running 
toward the window, tripping, falling, reaching out and breaking the window with their hand. 
In addition, we asked participants questions such as "What did you trip on? How did you feel?"
In one study 24 percent of the participants who imagined the broken-window scenario later 
reported an increase in confidence that the event had occurred, whereas  only 12 percent of 
those who were not asked to imagine the incident reported an increase in the likelihood that it 
had taken place. We found this "imagination inflation" effect in each of the eight events that
participants were asked to imagine. A number of possible explanations come to mind. An obvious 
one is that an act of imagination simply makes the event seem more familiar and that 
familiarity is mistakenly related to childhood memories rather than to the act of imagination. 
Such source confusion when a person does not remember the source of information can be especially
acute for the distant experiences of childhood.<BR><BR>
Studies by Lyn Giff and Henry L. Roediger III of Washington University of recent rather than 
childhood experiences more directly connect imagined actions to the construction of false memory.
During the initial session, the researchers instructed participants to perform the stated action,
imagine doing it or just listen to the statement and do nothing else. The actions were simple 
ones: knock on the table, lift the stapler, break the toothpick, cross your fingers, roll your 
eyes. During the second session, the participants were asked to imagine some of the actions that 
they had not previously performed. During the final session, they answered questions about what 
actions they actually performed during the initial session. The investigators found that the 
more times participants imagined an unperformed action, the more likely they were to remember 
having performed it.<BR><BR>

<H4 ALIGN=CENTER> Impossible Memories </H4>

<P>It is highly unlikely that an adult can recall genuine episodic memories from the first year 
of life, in part because the hippocampus, which plays a key role in the creation of memories, 
has not matured enough to form and store longlasting memories that can be retrieved in adulthood.</UL>

<IMG ALIGN=LEFT SRC="image7.gif" VSPACE=5>

<P>A procedure for planting "impossible" memories about experiences that occur shortly after 
birth has been developed by the late Nicholas Spanos and his collaborators at Carleton University.
Individuals are led to believe that they have well-coordinated eye movements and visual 
exploration skills probably because they were born in hospitals that hung swinging, colored 
mobiles over infant cribs. To confirm whether they had such an experience, half the participants 
are hypnotized, age-regressed to the day after birth and asked what they remembered. The other 
half of the group participates in a "guided mnemonic restructuring" procedure that uses age 
regression as well as active encouragement to re-create the infant experiences by imagining them..
Spanos and his co-workers found that the vast majority of their subjects were susceptible to 
these memory-planting procedures. Both the hypnotic and guided participants reported infant 
memories. Surprisingly, the guided group did so somewhat more (95 versus 70 percent). Both 
groups remembered the colored mobile at a relatively high rate (56 percent of the guided group 
and 46 percent of the hypnotic subjects). Many participants who did not remember the mobile did 
recall other things, such as doctors, nurses, bright lights, cribs and masks. Also, in both 
groups, of those who reported memories of infancy, 49 percent felt that they were real memories, 
as opposed to 16 percent who claimed that they were merely fantasies. These findings confirm
earlier studies that many individuals can be led to construct complex, vivid and detailed false 
memories via a rather simple procedure. Hypnosis clearly is not necessary.<BR><BR>

<H4 ALIGN=CENTER> How False Memories Form </H4>

<P>In the lost-in-the-mall study, implantation of false memory occurred when another person, 
usually a family member, claimed that the incident happened. Corroboration of an event by 
another person can be a powerful technique for instilling a false memory. In fact, merely 
claiming to have seen a person do something can lead that person to make a false confession of 
wrongdoing.<BR>
This effect was demonstrated in a study by Saul M. Kassin and his colleagues at Williams College,
who investigated the reactions of individuals falsely accused of damaging a computer by pressing 
the wrong key. The innocent participants initially denied the charge, but when a confederate 
said that she had seen them perform the action, many participants signed a confession, 
internalized guilt for the act and went on to confabulate details that were consistent with that 
belief. These findings show that false incriminating evidence can induce people to accept guilt 
for a crime they did not commit and even to develop memories to support their guilty feelings.<BR>
Research is beginning to give us an understanding of how false memories of complete, emotional 
and self-participatory experiences are created in adults. First, there are social demands on 
individuals to remember; for instance, researchers exert some pressure on participants in a 
study to come up with memories. Second, memory construction by imagining events can be 
explicitly encouraged when people are having trouble remembering. And, finally, individuals can 
be encouraged not to think about whether their constructions are real or not. Creation of false 
memories is most likely to occur when these external factors are present, whether in an 
experimental setting, in a therapeutic setting or during everyday activities.<BR><BR>
False memories are constructed by combining actual memories with the content of suggestions 
received from others. During the process, individuals may forget the source of the information. 
This is a classic example of source confusion, in which the content and the source become 
dissociated.<BR>
Of course, because we can implant false childhood memories in some individuals in no way 
implies that all memories that arise after suggestion are necessarily false. Put another way, 
although experimental work on the creation of false memories may raise doubt about the validity 
of long-buried memories, such as repeated trauma, it in no way disproves them. Without 
corroboration, there is little that can be done to help even the most experienced evaluator 
to differentiate true memories from ones that were suggestively planted.<BR><BR>
The precise mechanisms by which such false memories are constructed await further research. 
We still have much to learn about the degree of confidence and the characteristics of false 
memories created in these ways, and we need to discover what types of individuals are 
particularly susceptible to these forms of suggestion and who is resistant.<BR><BR>
As we continue this work, it is important to heed the cautionary tale in the data we have 
already obtained: mental health professionals and others must be aware of how greatly they can 
influence the recollection of events and of the urgent need for maintaining restraint in 
situations in which imagination is used as an aid in recovering presumably lost memories.<BR><BR>
